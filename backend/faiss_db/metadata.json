A reasonable, good-faith ATR evaluation must consider the following eight underwriting factors based on available information in the mortgage loan file using reliable third-party records:\n. Income or assets used to repay the loan.\n· Employment status.\n· Monthly mortgage payment on the subject loan (fully indexed, fully amortizing).\n· Monthly payments for any simultaneous loans secured by the subject property.\n· Monthly payments for property taxes, hazard insurance, HOA fees, or ground rents.\n· Debts (reported by a credit bureau or disclosed by the consumer), alimony, and child support obligations.\n. Monthly DTI or residual income.\n. Credit history.\n1.2 Exceptions & Items Not Addressed in this Guide\nUnless otherwise stated, Fannie Mae definitions, required documentation and underwriting guidelines should be followed. Additionally, while these Underwriting Guidelines are intended to be comprehensive, they may not encompass all specific loan or borrower scenarios.\nIn the event the underwriter determines an exception is warranted, the exception will be considered case by case, with compensating factors such as the below:\n. The borrower's residential payment history for 24 months is 0x30\n· 6 months reserves greater than the program required\n· FICO points greater than 20 points over required\n· DTI >10% below the program requirements or DSCR >1.15\n· LTV 10% below the maximum allowed\n. The borrower has additional income that is not used to qualify\nAll exceptions will be reviewed by the underwriting manager.\n1.3 Fair Lending\nFCM strictly complies with all applicable federal, state, and local requirements related to fair lending, including the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act (together, the \"Fair Lending Requirements\"). Accordingly, in connection with its decision to purchase loans, FCM will not discriminate on any prohibited basis.

Banking Law § 6-M (New York Subprime), FCM does not purchase mortgage loans that meet the definition of \"high cost,\" \"high risk,\" \"covered,\" \"subprime,\" or any similar designation under state or local law.\nNew York Subprime Definition:\nSubprime home loan means a home loan in which the initial interest rate or the fully-indexed rate, whichever is higher, exceeds by more than one and three-quarters percentage points for a first-lien loan, or by more than three and three- quarters percentage points for a subordinate-lien loan, the average commitment rate for loans in the northeast region with a comparable duration to the duration of such home loan, as published by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (herein \"Freddie Mac\") in its weekly Primary Mortgage Market Survey (PMMS) posted in the week prior to the week in which the lender provides the Loan Estimate.\n1.13 State Licensing\nFCM will comply with all applicable state licenses and registration requirements in connection with mortgage loan origination and any other related business activities, which include without limitation:\n· Ensuring that each loan officer/originator/broker involved in the origination of loans are appropriately licensed.\n· Maintaining appropriate organizational licensure based on type and location of the activities it engages in.\n1.14 TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosure (TRID)\nAll loans must comply with TRID rules except for loans originated solely for business purposes, as defined in 12 CFR 1026.3(a)(1)of Regulation Z.\nAs used in this Guide, a \"Business Purpose Loan\" means a loan:\n· Single Family Non-Owner Occupied: To acquire, improve or maintain rental property (regardless of the number of housing units) that is not owner-occupied. This includes, for example, a single-family house that will be rented to another person to live in. If the owner expects to occupy the property for more than 14 days during the coming year, the property cannot be considered non-owner-occupied, and this special rule will not apply. For example, a beach house that the owner will occupy for a month in the coming summer and rent out the rest of the year is owner occupied and is not Business Purpose Loan.\n. Loans meeting this definition of \"Business Purpose\" are not subject to ability to repay and TRID disclosure requirements; borrower(s) must affirm the purpose of the loan by executing a Business Purpose and Occupancy Affidavit or a similar form. If a Business Purpose disclosure is not in the file, then the merits of the file must indicate that the loan meets the definition of a Business Purpose loan.\n· Special rules also apply to Business Purpose loans where the borrower is taking cash out of the transaction. In such situations, the cash being taken out must also be used for a Business Purpose and not for personal or consumer use. This includes, for example, using the cash-out of the transaction to improve or maintain other rental properties owned by a borrower. An example of an impermissible use would include using the cash-out of transaction to pay for college tuition or personal debt (i.e., for a non-business purpose).\n. All DSCR loans are \"Business Purpose Loans\"; therefore, to be eligible for the product, the owner cannot occupy the property at any time during the coming year and all cash out proceeds must only be used for business purposes (e.g., acquisition/maintenance/improvement of rental properties).\n1.15 OFAC Search\nThe Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) of the US Department of Treasury administers and enforces economic and trade sanctions based on US foreign policy and national security goals against individuals and foreign countries.

Implicit in this definition is the execution of a lease as of a specified date under conditions whereby\nLessee and lessor are typically motivated; Both parties are well informed or well advised, and acting in what they consider their best interests;\nPayment is made in terms of cash or in terms of financial arrangements comparable thereto; and\nThe rent reflects specified terms and conditions, such as permitted uses, use restrictions, expense obligations, duration, concessions, rental adjustments and revaluations, renewal and purchase options, and tenant improvements(Tls). (The Dictionary of Real Estate Appraisal. 7th ed., 2022. pp. 116-117) STATEMENT OF ASSUMPTIONS AND LIMITING CONDITIONS: The intended use of the Market Rent Analysis is to be a screening tool for collateral evaluation involving a financial lending institution.

The property description supplied to an used by the appraiser is assumed to be correct.

Unless otherwise stated in this report, the existence of hazardous material, which may or may not be present on the property, was not observed by the appraiser. However, the appraiser is no qualified to detect such substances. The presence of substances such as asbestos, urea-formaldehyde foam insulation or other potentially hazardous materials may affect the value of the property. The value conclusions in this report are predicated on the assumption that there is no such materials on or in the property that would cause a loss of value. No responsibility is assumed for any such conditions, or for the expertise required to discover them. The client is urged to retain an expert in this field if desired. The analysis and value conclusions in this report are null and void should any hazardous material be discovered.\n8.

In the event such an inspection was not possible: and or if a limited inspection ws performed or no inspection was performed, this market rent analysis shall so state. In cases where the appraiser was limited in his ability to perform a thorough property inspection, assumptions were made using the best information available to him or her at the time, relative to improvement size, quality, condition, use; and physical attributes of the land and improvements. For purposes of the analysis these assumptions became matters of fact and were used as such. The appraiser shall not be held liable for conditions not apparent to him or her, and assumes no liability for damages occurring there from, when the inspection opportunities were limited.\n17.

See EXHIBIT B: Ability-To-Repay Borrower Confirmation for an example in the Exhibits section of this guide. * Note: Business Purpose/Investment property transactions are exempt from completing this form.\nSTATE AND FEDERAL HIGH-COST LOANS\nHigh-cost loans are not permitted.\nPREPAYMENT PENALTY\nFor Investment Property transactions when permitted by applicable laws and regulations, a prepayment charge can be structured to be assessed if prepayment occurs between the first twelve (12) to sixty (60) payments due on the loan.\nThe prepayment charge shall be equal to six (6) months interest at the then applicable Interest Rate on the amount prepaid that exceeds twenty percent (20%) of the original principal balance of the loan. The prepayment charge shall be assessed if the loan is paid due to sale or refinance of the property or any curtailments that exceed twenty percent (20%) of the original principal amount of the loan in any given twelve (12) month period.\nThe following states are subject to local jurisdiction prepayment penalty rules and regulations:\no District of Columbia, Illinois, Michigan, Mississippi, New Jersey, Ohio, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, Utah and Virginia.\n.

The coverage must provide for claims to be settled on a replacement cost basis. Extended coverage must include, at a minimum, wind, civil commotion (including riots), smoke, hail, and damage caused by aircraft, vehicle, or explosion.\nPolicies that limit or exclude from coverage (in whole or in part) windstorm, hurricane, hail damages, or any other perils that normally are included under an extended coverage endorsement are not acceptable.\nBorrowers may not obtain property insurance policies that include such limitations or exclusions unless they are able to obtain a separate policy or endorsement from another commercial insurer that provides adequate coverage for the limited or excluded peril or from an insurance pool that the state has established to cover the limitations or exclusions.\nAdditional requirements apply to properties with solar panels that are leased from or owned by a third party under a power purchase agreement or other similar arrangement.\nThe insurance coverage should reflect one of the following:\n. 100% of the insurable value of the improvements, as established by the property insurer; or\n· 100% of the Total Estimate of Cost-New per the appraiser; or\n. The unpaid principal balance of the mortgage, as long as it at least equals the minimum amount-80% of the insurable value of the improvements-required to compensate for damage or loss on a replacement cost basis. If it does not, then coverage that does provide the minimum required amount must be obtained.\nFor insurance not addressed in this section, default to Fannie Mae requirements.\nRent Loss Insurance\nFor Investment Properties - rent loss insurance covering a minimum of 6 months of the rental figure used to qualify is required for the subject property.\nTRANSACTION TYPES\nELIGIBLE TRANSACTIONS\nPurchase\n.

Implicit in this definition is the execution of a lease as of a specified date under conditions whereby Lessee and lessor are typically motivated; Both parties are well informed or well advised, and acting in what they consider their best interests;\nPayment is made in terms of cash or in terms of financial arrangements comparable thereto; and\nThe rent reflects specified terms and conditions, such as permitted uses, use restrictions, expense obligations, duration, concessions, rental adjustments and revaluations, renewal and purchase options, and tenant improvements(Tls). (The Dictionary of Real Estate Appraisal. 7th ed., 2022. pp. 116-117) STATEMENT OF ASSUMPTIONS AND LIMITING CONDITIONS: The intended use of the Market Rent Analysis is to be a screening tool for collateral evaluation involving a financial lending institution.

The property description supplied to an used by the appraiser is assumed to be correct.

No survey of the property has been made or reviewed by the appraiser, and no responsibility is assumed in connection with such matters. Illustrative material, including photos, maps, plots, plans, utilized in this report are inclusive only to assist the reader in visualizing the property.

Property titles are assumed to be good and merchantable unless otherwise stated.\n4. Information furnished by others is believed to be true, correct, and reliable.

Unless otherwise stated in this report, the existence of hazardous material, which may or may not be present on the property, was not observed by the appraiser. However, the appraiser is no qualified to detect such substances. The presence of substances such as asbestos, urea-formaldehyde foam insulation or other potentially hazardous materials may affect the value of the property. The value conclusions in this report are predicated on the assumption that there is no such materials on or in the property that would cause a loss of value. No responsibility is assumed for any such conditions, or for the expertise required to discover them. The client is urged to retain an expert in this field if desired. The analysis and value conclusions in this report are null and void should any hazardous material be discovered.\n8.

The appraiser was available to perform a complete interior inspection of the subject property. In the event such an inspection was not possible: and or if a limited inspection ws performed or no inspection was performed, this market rent analysis shall so state. In cases where the appraiser was limited in his ability to perform a thorough property inspection, assumptions were made using the best information available to him or her at the time, relative to improvement size, quality, condition, use; and physical attributes of the land and improvements. For purposes of the analysis these assumptions became matters of fact and were used as such. The appraiser shall not be held liable for conditions not apparent to him or her, and assumes no liability for damages occurring there from, when the inspection opportunities were limited.\n17.

Implicit in this definition is the execution of a lease as of a specified date under conditions whereby\nLessee and lessor are typically motivated; Both parties are well informed or well advised, and acting in what they consider their best interests;\nPayment is made in terms of cash or in terms of financial arrangements comparable thereto; and\nThe rent reflects specified terms and conditions, such as permitted uses, use restrictions, expense obligations, duration, concessions, rental adjustments and revaluations, renewal and purchase options, and tenant improvements(Tls). (The Dictionary of Real Estate Appraisal. 7th ed., 2022. pp. 116-117) STATEMENT OF ASSUMPTIONS AND LIMITING CONDITIONS: The intended use of the Market Rent Analysis is to be a screening tool for collateral evaluation involving a financial lending institution. This analysis is not intended to represent a Market Value of the Real Estate or a Market Value of theGoing Concern as a short term rental property.\n1. The property description supplied to an used by the appraiser is assumed to be correct. Where property addresses and other incomplete descriptions were supplied and falling short of complete legal descriptions, the appraiser used property tax records, local property data services and other resources available to determine an adequate property description for purposes of performing the market rent analysis. The appraiser assumes no responsibility for damages resulting from inadequate property descriptions by the client.\n2. No survey of the property has been made or reviewed by the appraiser, and no responsibility is assumed in connection with such matters. Illustrative material, including photos, maps, plots, plans, utilized in this report are inclusive only to assist the reader in visualizing the property. Property dimensions and sizes are considered to be approximate.\n3. No responsibility is assumed for matters of a legal nature affecting title to the property, nor is any opinion of title rendered. Property titles are assumed to be good and merchantable unless otherwise stated.\n4. Information furnished by others is believed to be true, correct, and reliable. However, no responsibility for its accuracy is assumed by the appraiser.\n5. All mortgages, liens, leases, property tax obligations and servitudes have been disregarded unless so specified within the report. The property is assumed to be free of all encumbrances and under responsible, financially sound ownership and competent management.\n6. It is assumed that there are no hidden or unapparent conditions of the property, subsoil, or structures which would render the property more or less valuable. No responsibility is assumed for such conditions or for arranging for engineering studies which may be required to discover them.\n7. Unless otherwise stated in this report, the existence of hazardous material, which may or may not be present on the property, was not observed by the appraiser. However, the appraiser is no qualified to detect such substances. The presence of substances such as asbestos, urea-formaldehyde foam insulation or other potentially hazardous materials may affect the value of the property. The value conclusions in this report are predicated on the assumption that there is no such materials on or in the property that would cause a loss of value. No responsibility is assumed for any such conditions, or for the expertise required to discover them. The client is urged to retain an expert in this field if desired. The analysis and value conclusions in this report are null and void should any hazardous material be discovered.\n8. Unless otherwise stated in this report, no environmental impact studies were either requested or made in conjunction with this report. The appraiser reserves the right to alter, amend, revise, or rescind any opinions of value based upon any subsequent environmental impact studies, research, or investigation, all without penalty.\n9. It is assumed that there is full compliance with all applicable federal, state, and local environmental regulations and laws unless noncompliance is specified, defined, and considered in this report.\n10. It is assumed that all applicable building permit requirements, building codes, zoning regulations, and use restrictions have been complied with, unless non- conformity has been specified, defined, and considered in this report.\n11. It is assumed that all required licenses, certificates of occupancy, consents, or other legislative or administrative authority from any local, state, or federal government or private entity or organization have been or can be obtained or renewed for any use on which the value estimate is based.\n12. The appraiser will not be required to give testimony or appear in court because of having made this report, unless arrangements have previously been made.\n13. Possession of this report, or a copy thereof, does not carry with it the right of publication. It may not be used for any purpose by any person other than the client and other intended users without the written consent of the appraiser, and in any event, only with properly written qualification and only in its entirety.\n14 This is a restricted appraisal repart In some cases the appraiser's opinion and enneluciane cet farth in the report may not he understand properly withnuit additional information in the appraiser's work file. The liability of the appraiser is limited to the client only. There is no accountability, obligation, or liability to any third party. It is the responsibility of the client to restrict dissemination of this report only to those within its organization and to others as provided by state and federal law, and regulatory agencies on an as needed basis. If this report is placed in the hands of anyone other than the client, the client shall assume all responsibility for its use and shall make such party aware of all limiting conditions and assumptions of the assignment and related discussions.\n15. Neither all nor any part of the contents of this report, or copy thereof, shall be conveyed to the public through advertising, public relations, news, sales, or any other media without written consent and approval of the appraiser. Nor shall the appraiser, client, firm, or professional organization of which the appraiser is a member be identified without the written consent of the appraiser.\n16. The appraiser was available to perform a complete interior inspection of the subject property. In the event such an inspection was not possible: and or if a limited inspection ws performed or no inspection was performed, this market rent analysis shall so state. In cases where the appraiser was limited in his ability to perform a thorough property inspection, assumptions were made using the best information available to him or her at the time, relative to improvement size, quality, condition, use; and physical attributes of the land and improvements. For purposes of the analysis these assumptions became matters of fact and were used as such. The appraiser shall not be held liable for conditions not apparent to him or her, and assumes no liability for damages occurring there from, when the inspection opportunities were limited.\n17. Acceptance and/or use of this report constitutes acceptance of the foregoing assumptions and limiting conditions.\n5 of 6\nChange Home Mortgage - Alt Doc Express 08/08/2025\n69 | Page\n\nSTRpro®\nLoan #:\nOrder ID: 1216281\nAPPRAISER'S CERTIFICATIONS: I certify that, to the best of my knowledge and belief:\n1.

Additional characteristics of the loan are also examined including credit history, asset position, and the property being used for collateral.\nARDRI funds a wide variety of loan products. While all the products are not of a conventional nature, the loans must be sound and prudent for the associated Program Matrix whose methodology relies on \"risk-based\" pricing based on characteristics and credit scoring associated with each loan scenario. The ARDRI Non-Prime Residential Lending Program\" is a first and second lien mortgage products offering designed to provide non-conventional credit liquidity to the residential real estate market for both primary residences, secondary residences, and non- owner-occupied properties. To assist our broker base in determining if loans submitted for funding are prudent and meet ARDRI's eligibility standards, ARDRI has created these Guidelines. The loan parameters and the adherence of a loan to these Guidelines determine a loan's eligibility for funding by ARDRI.\nARDRI's Loan Purchase Eligibility Guidelines establish the criteria under which a loan will be eligible for purchase by ARDRI. ARDRI does not require TPOs to make any loan simply because it is eligible for purchase by ARDRI, nor does ARDRI prohibit TPOs from originating a loan that is ineligible for purchase by ARDRI. TPOs should rely on their own underwriting guidelines to determine whether to extend credit to any applicant.\nLoans that do not meet all the applicable guidelines may not be declined from loan approval by ARDRI. Exceptions to the guidelines will be considered on a case-by-case basis, provided that compensating factors exist, and they are beneficial to ARDRI. Loans that have too many layering of risks not covered in our guidelines or matrix's may be declined. All underwriting, loan program policy and procedure standards not specifically addressed in the Guidelines may still be approved by the Underwriter through \"common sense\" decision making.\nARDRI has a no-tolerance policy as it relates to fraud. TPOs should follow their own established fraud and identity procedures on every loan to prevent and detect fraud (including, but not limited to, Social Security Number verification, appraisal independence, income documents, all verifications, etc.). Loans containing fraudulent documentation or information will immediately be declined and forwarded for further review. If there is any determination of TPO involvement, the TPO will be made inactive, and the appropriate agencies notified. ARDRI will fully pursue borrower(s) or affiliated party fraud to the fullest extent of the law.\nCPN.BPA.BPD.BPN.rev20250325\nPage | 12\n\nARDRI\nARDRI NON-PRIME LOAN PROGRAM GUIDELINES\n*All guidelines are subject to change based on current market conditions and or sound business practices\n1.2 FAIR LENDING STATEMENT\nARDRI operates in accordance with the Fair Housing Act and Equal Credit Opportunity Act. The Fair Housing Act makes it unlawful to discriminate in housing-related activities against any person because of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, handicap, or familial status. The Equal Credit Opportunity Act prohibits discrimination with respect to any aspect of a credit transaction on the basis of sex, race, color, religion, national origin, marital status, age (provided the borrower has the capacity to enter into a binding contract), receipt of public assistance, or because the borrower has in good faith exercised any right under the Consumer Credit Protection Act. ARDRI fully supports the letter and spirit of both laws and will not condone discrimination in any mortgage transaction.\nEach Broker, Correspondent Lender and the loans submitted by them shall comply with all underwriting guidelines contained within. All loans are made pursuant to all State, Federal, RESPA, Reg Z, Section 32, Section 35, and Dodd Frank Federal High-Cost lending laws when applicable. Please also refer to current Rate Matrices for additional guidelines and information that supplements these guidelines.\n1.3 RESPONSIBLE LENDING STATEMENT\nThe primary focus of this lending program is the borrower's or property's ability to repay the mortgage obligation. Loans purchased by ARDRI should be affordable to the borrower in his or her pursuit of homeownership.\nUnder the general Ability-to-Repay (ATR) standard for Consumer Purpose and Business Purpose ATR loans, lenders must make a reasonable, good-faith determination that the consumer has a reasonable ability to repay the loan. Lenders must verify information using third-party records that provide reliable evidence of income or assets.\nIf a loan is subject to the ATR rules under the Federal Truth in Lending Act (\"TILA\"), lenders must consider eight underwriting factors to be in compliance with the following:\n· Current or reasonably expected income or assets (other than the value of the property that secures the loan) that the consumer will rely on to repay the loan.\n· Current employment status (if you rely on employment income when assessing the consumer's ability to repay)\n· Monthly mortgage payment for this loan. You calculate this using the introductory or fully indexed rate, whichever is higher, and monthly, fully amortizing payments that are equal.\n· Monthly payment on any simultaneous loans secured by the same property.\n· Monthly payments for property taxes and insurance that you require the consumer to buy, and certain other costs related to the property such as homeowner's association fees or ground rent.\n· Debts, alimony, and child support obligations\nCPN.BPA.BPD.BPN.rev20250325\nPage | 13\n\nARDRI NON-PRIME LOAN PROGRAM GUIDELINES\nARDRI\n· Monthly debt-to-income ratio or residual income, that you calculated using the total of all the mortgage and non-mortgage obligations listed above, as a ratio of gross monthly income\n· Credit history.\nARDRI will not fund or purchase a loan subject to the ATR requirement under TILA unless it meets the requirements of the rule. Certain loans may be exempt from TILA or otherwise exempt from the ATR rule like Business Purpose DSCR loans. In those cases, though ARDRI may choose to purchase a loan that does not adhere to the formal requirements of the ATR rule, ARDRI will only fund or purchase loans that the applicant appears able to afford based on application of prudent underwriting standards.\n1.3.1 ELDERLY FINANCIAL ABUSE\nDefrauding a person aged 62 or older for financial gain or property exploitation means illegal or improper use of an elder person(s) money, property, or other source of monetary value, is prohibited. If documentation provided supports elder abuse or alerts suspicious activity further investigation by the Underwriter or Sr. Management will be required. The outcome may result in the decline of the loan and proper authorities will be notified to pursue criminal activity to the fullest extent of the law.\n2 GENERAL PROGRAM INFORMATION\n2.1 PROGRAMS\nARDRI offers several loan programs.

Buydown options are available to reduce or remove prepayment penalties. See the appropriate ARDRI Mortgage Rate Sheet for details. Prepayment penalties on Consumer Purpose Non-Prime Transactions are prohibited.\n· No Prepayment Protection: This option carries NO charge for early payoff.\n· Level I Prepayment Protection for Business Purpose: A Prepayment fee will be assessed at the chosen prepayment period at 5% of the amount being prepaid. See current rate sheets and pricing matrices for options and restrictions.\n· Level 2 Prepayment Protection for Business Purpose Loans: A Prepayment fee will be assessed at the chosen prepayment period at 6 months interest on 80% of the balance. See current rate sheets and pricing matrices for options and restrictions.\nARDRI will offer the broker and borrower several pricing options, including NO LENDER POINTS options (i.e., par pricing).\nThe maximum amount of points that ARDRI will allow its brokers to charge is 3% of the loan amount or the maximum allowable fee as determined by the law, for high-cost mortgages on Consumer Purpose loans. It is up to the underwriter's discretion to reduce the maximum allowable points on any approval if the underwriter feels the Borrower(s) fees are excessive. Underwriters should be particularly sensitive for borrowers that live on a fixed income or are retired. We may allow brokers to charge an additional processing fee (if ARDRI is not processing the loan) not to exceed $995 for loan amounts $250,000 or less and not to exceed $1495 for loan amounts over $250,000. Cannot hit high-cost status on a consumer loan.\nBased on management operating history, many of our funded loans have come from loan scenarios where our brokers have charged two points or less. Further analysis suggests that an even greater percentage of the Conditional Loan Approvals issued by ARDRI where our brokers charge more than two points do not execute or die prior to funding.\nNote: States may impose different definitions of points and fees, rate/APR, or prepayment penalties than apply under HOEPA. States may also use different triggers in each category for determining whether a loan will be a \"high-cost mortgage\" (or equivalent terms) under state law. As a matter of policy, ARDRI does not fund or purchase loans defined as high-cost mortgages (or equivalent terms) under Federal or state law, regardless of the basis for the loan's treatment as such. The TPO should not confuse high-cost mortgages with higher-priced mortgages for ARDRI regularly approves higher-priced mortgages.\n2.8 EXCEPTIONS\nExceptions to published guidelines are considered on a case-by-case basis. Loans with an exception request should\nCPN.BPA.BPD.BPN.rev20250325\nPage | 16\n\nARDRI\nARDRI NON-PRIME LOAN PROGRAM GUIDELINES\nexhibit strong compensating factors. All exception requests must be submitted by the TPO in writing to ARDRI on the ARDRI Exception Approval Form along with any supporting documentation.\nARDRI's decision to allow or deny any exception request relates only to whether ARDRI will fund or purchase a loan. The decision does not bind a TPO regarding the underlying decision to extend credit.\n2.9 ALTERNATIVE LOAN PROGRAM ANALYSIS\nLoan applications are to be reviewed for approval under a traditional conventional conforming or FHA loan program offered by the TPO before submitting to ARDRI.\n3 TRANSACTIONS\n3.1 OCCUPANCY\n3.1.1 PRIMARY RESIDENCE\nA primary residence (or owner-occupied property) is a dwelling occupied by the borrower as his or her principal residence.\nTo qualify as a primary residence, the transaction must meet each of the following criteria:\n· The subject property address is reflected on the borrower's driver's license unless the borrower moved into the property within the last 12 months OR is a purchase transaction.\n· The borrower intends to occupy the subject property for the majority of the year.\n· Property possesses physical characteristics that accommodate the borrower's family.\nIf borrower is unable to provide the driver's license with the subject property address and occupancy is in question, provide the most recent two (2) months of at least three (3) of the following documentations below that reflect the subject property address:\n· Bank Statement\n· Cable Bill\n· Internet Bill\n· Credit Card Statement\n· Car Registration\n· Cell Phone Statement\nUtility Bills are not acceptable proof to meet occupancy requirements.\n3.1.2 SECOND HOME\nA second home is a dwelling occupied by the borrower in addition to their primary residence (may also be referred to as a vacation home).

Title Transfer\n· Property Retention\n· Rate Reduction\n· P&I Reduction\n· Debt Reduction\n. Uncontrolled Cash-Out\n3.3.3 PROPERTIES LISTED FOR SALE\nTo be eligible for either a rate/term or a cash-out refinance, the subject property must be taken off the market on or before Clear to Close is issued.\nFor cash-out transactions, if the subject property was listed for sale in the 6 months prior to application date, a 10% LTV reduction from the maximum available for the specific transaction is required and a minimum 1- point Lender Discount Fee will be assessed (Broker Rebate is not available) If Investment Property, a mandatory one (1) year prepayment penalty is imposed.\nThe lesser of the most recent list price or the current appraised value should be used to determine loan- to- value for both rate/term or cash-out transactions.\n3.4 RATE/TERM REFINANCE\nA rate/term refinance is the refinancing of an existing mortgage for the purpose of changing the interest and/or term of a mortgage without advancing new money on the loan.\nThe mortgage amount for a rate/term refinance is limited to the sum of the following:\n· Existing first mortgage payoff\n· Closing costs and prepaid items (interest, taxes, insurance) on the new mortgage\n· Payoff of all title liens, judgements, or delinquent property taxes\n.

Properties acquired through REO's, or Bank owned properties are excluded from this guideline.\nFlip transactions are subject to the following requirements:\n· All transactions must be arm's length, with no identity of interest between the buyer and property Seller or other parties participating in the sales transaction.\n.

Mortgage on the subject property not reflected on the original credit report must be documented from a Financial Institution Verification of Mortgage (VOM). A combined total of all late mortgage payments in the past 12 months must be used to determine the housing history.\nIf the borrower is making payments to a private or interested party and there are inconsistencies or ARDRI is unable to validate the information on the private VOM 12 months cancelled checks or bank statements along with a VOM must be obtained. In some circumstances the original note outlining terms may be used in lieu of the VOM so that the Underwriter may understand the terms of the loan.\nAll mortgages should be current at the time of closing. If the credit report or VOM or Demand Statement reflects a past-due status, updated documentation is required to verify the account is current and may be downgraded to a different program to include delinquency.\nFor all loans, we are only analyzing mortgage histories for properties that are reported on credit (not all REO) along with the subject property. If mortgages on credit have perfect pay history for last 12 months but credit report has not updated rating for less than 60 days, no credit supplement is needed. If other mortgages have not rated greater than 60 days, credit supplements will need to verify mortgage is current. For Consumer Purpose Refinances, ARDRI requires a VOM for the loan that is being paid off.\nFor Consumer Purpose Purchases, ARDRI requires a VOM for the departing residence, or a VOR if the borrower rents (and doesn't live rent free).\nFor all Consumer Purpose loans, all known debts must be analyzed for the purpose of calculating DTI.\n5.5.1 NO HOUSING HISTORY OR LESS THAN 12 MONTHS VERIFIED\nBorrowers who do not have a complete 12-month housing history are subject to the following restrictions:\n· Will comply with the VOM/VOR history on rate sheet and matrices. . See Payment Shock consideration - Section 9.3 Payment Shock\n· Subject Property owned free and clear is considered 0x30 for grading purposes.\n· If Property Taxes and/or HOA are past due, must be brought current through closing.\n· If Property Taxes are in Tax Lien sale, loan is ineligible.\n· If HOA has filed Notice of Default, loan is ineligible.\n· Borrowers living with family members must be indicated on the URLA application and a letter from the relative stating the Borrower pays no rent is required. Please refer to the Rate sheet/Matrices for No VOM/VOR pricing hit.\n5.5.2 MORTGAGE MODIFICATION\nCPN.BPA.BPD.BPN.rev20250325\nPage | 47\n\nARDRI\nARDRI NON-PRIME LOAN PROGRAM GUIDELINES\nA mortgage modification resulting in any of the attributes listed below is subject to Housing Event seasoning guidelines under 5.15 Housing Events:\n· Forgiveness of a portion of principal and/or interest on either the first or junior mortgage(s).\n· Application of a principal curtailment by or on behalf of the investor to simulate principal forgiveness.\n· Conversion of any portion of the original mortgage debt to a \"soft\" subordinate mortgage\n· Conversion of any portion of the original mortgage debt from secured too unsecured.\n5.5.3 ROLLING MORTGAGE LATE PAYMENTS\n• Rolling 30-day late payments up to six consecutive months equals 1x30.\n• Rolling 60-day late payments or more are never considered rolling mortgage late payments.\n5.6 VERIFICATION OF RENT (VOR)\nWhen and if a VOR is needed or requested, the following requirements apply:\n. VOR needs to be from an Institutional Landlord, orRental Agency, OR\n· Private VOR with proof of borrowers payment for most recent 6 months (cancelled checks or bank statements)\no Requirement for 6 months proof of payment is waived with minimum credit score of 700.\n5.7 PAST DUE ACCOUNTS\nPast due consumer debts (not mortgages) can be no more than 30 days past due at the time of closing on Consumer Purpose only unless those debts are being paid off through closing. Paying off consumer debt can only be used on Consumer Purpose programs and Business Purpose ATR.\n5.8 WRITTEN EXPLANATIONS FOR DEROGATORY CREDIT\nLetter of Explanation is generally not required.\n5.9 DELINQUENT CREDIT BELONGING TO EX-SPOUSE\nDelinquent credit belonging to an ex-spouse can be excluded from the credit evaluation when all the following apply:\n· The borrower provides a copy of the divorce decree signed by the judge or separation agreement signed by all parties and their attorneys, which shows the derogatory accounts belong solely to the ex-spouse.\n. Late payments occurred after the date of the divorce or separation.\nCollection accounts assigned to an ex-spouse may be excluded from aggregate collection totals with a divorce decree or separation agreement assigning the account solely to the ex-spouse.\nSee also 6.6 Contingent Liabilities.\n5.10 LAWSUIT/PENDING LITIGATION\nCPN.BPA.BPD.BPN.rev20250325\nPage | 48\n\nARDRI NON-PRIME LOAN PROGRAM GUIDELINES\nARDRI\nIf the application, title, or credit documents reveal that the borrower is presently involved in a lawsuit or pending litigation, a statement from the borrower's attorney is required. The statement must explain the circumstances of the lawsuit or litigation and discuss the borrower's liability and insurance coverage. A copy of the complaint and answer may also be needed. The title company closing the loan must be informed of the lawsuit or litigation and provide affirmative coverage of our first lien position.\n. ARDRI must obtain a $500 Non-Refundable Litigation Review Fee via wire (CLICK HERE for wire instructions), prior to further underwriting review. Loan placed in Suspense until Litigation Review Fee is received.\n5.11 CONSUMER CREDIT COUNSELING SERVICE (CCCS)\nBecause ARDRI believes Consumer Credit Counseling Services negatively affects borrowers' FICO score, no further action is needed if Purchase or Rate/Term refinancing. If a Cash-out Refinance transaction, all Consumer Credit Counseling Service accounts MUST be paid through the close of escrow. THIS IS ONLY APPLICABLE FOR CONSUMER PURPOSE LOANS.\n5.12 WAGE GARNISHMENTS, JUDGEMENTS, COLLECTIONS AND CHARGE-OFFS ON CONSUMER LOANS ONLY\nThe following accounts may remain open:\n. Wage Garnishments, Judgements, Collections, and charge-offs < 24 months old with an individual balance of $2,500 or more that does not affect title.\n· Wage Garnishments, Judgments, Collections, and charge-offs ≥ 24 months old with a $3,500 or more per occurrence that does not affect title.\n· All medical collections\nCollection and charge-off balances exceeding the amounts listed above must be paid in full under the Consumer Purpose Programs.\nUnder all other circumstances, wage garnishments, judgement, collection, and charge-off account balances remaining after the exclusions listed above may remain open when one of the following is met:\n· Payment for remaining wage garnishments, judgements, collections, and charge-offs included in DTI results in final DTI ≤ 50% (payment calculated at 5% of the balance of remaining unpaid collections and charge-offs).\n· If Wage Garnishment, a copy of the recorded Wage Garnishment must be provided to indicate for wage garnishments that is being deducted from the paystub, multiplied times the amount of the Borrower's Pay Period(s) and used in the Debt-to-Income (DTI) Ratio.\n5.13 JUDGMENTS, PROPERTY TAXES, WAGE GARNISHMENTS AND MECHANIC LIENS SECURING SUBJECT PROPERTY\nCPN.BPA.BPD.BPN.rev20250325\nPage | 49\n\nARDRI\nARDRI NON-PRIME LOAN PROGRAM GUIDELINES\nAny Judgments, Property Taxes, Wage Garnishments, Mechanics, and Tax liens must be paid at closing.

The Housing\nEvent must\nbe completed\nprior to\nloan closing\nwith no outstanding deficiency\nbalance remaining.\nFor a 120-day mortgage late, seasoning is from the date the mortgage was brought current. Seasoning for a modification is from the date the modification was executed. See also 5.5.2 Mortgage Modification.\nIf the property was surrendered in a Chapter 7 bankruptcy, the bankruptcy discharge date is used for seasoning. Bankruptcy papers may be required to show the property was surrendered. The foreclosure action is not required to be fully complete.\nSee Rate Sheet and Matrices for Pricing and Eligibility\n5 LIABILITIES\n6.1 INSTALLMENT DEBT\nInstallment debt is a monthly obligation with fixed payments and terms and is included in Borrower(s) DTI except\nCPN.BPA.BPD.BPN.rev20250325\nPage | 50",

The minimum required payment as stated on the credit report or current account statement should be used to calculate the debt-to-income ratio. If no payment is stated on the credit report, the greater of $10 or 5% of the current balance should be included in the debt-to-income ratio calculation.\nRevolving accounts can be paid off prior to or at closing to exclude the payment from the debt ratio. If paying off prior to closing, supporting documentation, such as a credit supplement or direct verification from the creditor, must be obtained as evidence the debt has been paid in full. See 7.3 Asset Documentation for sourcing and seasoning requirements.\nRevolving debt can be paid through closing and excluded from DTI if the payoff is included on the Closing Disclosure and the paid off balance matches the credit report or current statement.\n6.3 CO-SIGNED DEBT\nAll authorized and co-signed debt must be included in the DTI except for the following:\n12 months cancelled checks or Bank Statements coming from the responsible party.\n6.3.1 AUTHORIZED USER ACCOUNTS\nAuthorized user accounts will be excluded from Borrower(s) DTI.\n6.4 BUSINESS DEBT\nA business debt is a financial obligation of a business and can be the sole responsibility of the business or be personally secured by the business owner, making that person also liable for the debt. If the debt is reflected in the borrower's personal credit report, the borrower is personally liable for the debt, and it must be included in the debt-to-income ratio.\nDebts paid by the borrower's business can be excluded from the debt-to-income ratio with any of the following supporting documentation:\n. Most recent 6 months canceled checks drawn against the business account; or\n:selected:\nIf the debt is less than 6 months old, the payment must be included in the debt-to-income ratio.\nCPN.BPA.BPD.BPN.rev20250325\nPage | 51\n\nARDRI\nARDRI NON-PRIME LOAN PROGRAM GUIDELINES\n6.5 CHILD SUPPORT, ALIMONY, OR MAINTENANCE OBLIGATIONS\nFor Consumer Purpose Loans Only, monthly alimony, child support or separate maintenance fees should be current at time of application and must be included in the borrower's debt-to-income ratio. The file should contain supporting documentation as evidence of the obligation, such as a final divorce decree, property settlement agreement, signed legal separation agreement, or court order. If payments are past due, the arrearages must be brought current prior to or at closing.\nIf 10 or fewer payments remain, see 6.1 Installment Debt to determine if the obligation may be excluded from the DTI calculation.\n6.6 CONTINGENT LIABILITIES\nAn individual has contingent liability when an outstanding debt has been assigned to another party and the creditor does not release the borrower from liability. Contingent liabilities can be excluded from the debt-to- income ratio under any of the following scenarios:\n· Property resulting from buyout of former co-owner (i.e., divorce): file must include the court order and evidence of transfer of ownership.\n· Mortgage assumption by third party: file must include the formal assumption agreement and evidence of transfer of ownership.\n· Court ordered assignment of debts: file must include a copy of the court order assigning the debt to another party.\n· Payment history for the assigned debt after the effective date will not be considered in the credit grade.\n· Debts opened jointly with a former spouse must be considered in the calculation of DTI on consumer loan transactions unless a legal separation agreement, final stipulated judgment or final divorce decree shows the borrower is not responsible for the debt. All pages of the divorce decree must be provided.\n6.7 DEBTS PAID BY OTHERS\nWhen a borrower is obligated on a non-mortgage debt but is not the party repaying the debt, the monthly payment may be excluded from the borrower's recurring monthly obligations. This policy applies whether or not the other party is obligated on the debt but does not apply if the other party is an interested party to the subject transaction (such as the TPO or realtor). Non-mortgage debts include installment loans, student loans, revolving accounts, lease payments, alimony, child support, and separate maintenance.\nWhen a borrower is obligated on a mortgage debt but is not the party who is repaying the debt, the full monthly payment may be excluded from the borrower's recurring monthly obligations if:\n:selected: . The party making the payments is obligated on the mortgage debt,\n· There are no delinquencies in the most recent 12 months, and\n.

When a borrower is obligated on a mortgage debt, regardless of whether the other party is making the monthly mortgage payments, the referenced property must be included in the count of financed properties.\n6.8 HOUSING PAYMENTS\nThe monthly mortgage payment (PITIA) used for qualification consists of the following:\n· Principal and Interest\n· Hazard and flood and insurance premiums\n· Real Estate Taxes\nSpecial Assessments\n· Association Dues\nAny subordinate financing payments on mortgages secured by the subject property.\n6.9 LEASE OBLIGATIONS\nLease obligations must be included in the debt-to-income ratio calculation, regardless of the time remaining on the lease.\n6.10 OPEN 30-DAY CHARGE ACCOUNTS\nFor open 30-day charge accounts that do not reflect a monthly payment on the credit report, or 30-day accounts that reflect a monthly payment that is identical to the account balance, 5% of the outstanding balance will be the required monthly payment.\nOpen-end\naccounts do not have to be\nincluded in\nthe monthly\ndebt payment\nif the borrower has sufficient funds\nto pay off\nthe\noutstanding account\nbalance. The\nfunds must\nbe verified in\naddition to any funds required for\nclosing and reserves.\nIf the borrower paid off the account balance prior to closing, proof of payoff may be provided in lieu of verifying funds to cover the account balance.\n6.11 RETIREMENT/SAVINGS PLAN/401K/IRA'S LOANS\nMonthly payment obligation must be used in the debt ratios. Payments for loans against a financial asset (retirement/savings plan, insurance policy) can be excluded from the total debt-to-income ratio provided the debt can be repaid by liquidating the asset. The value of the asset must be reduced by the amount of the debt when calculating funds to close and reserves.\n6.12 STUDENT LOANS\nIf a monthly student loan payment is provided on the credit report, that amount may be used for qualifying purposes. If the credit report does not reflect the correct monthly payment, the monthly payment that is on the\nCPN.BPA.BPD.BPN.rev20250325\nPage | 53\n\nARDRI\nARDRI NON-PRIME LOAN PROGRAM GUIDELINES\nstudent loan documentation (the most recent student loan statement) may be used to qualify the borrower.\nIf the credit report does not provide a monthly payment for the student loan, or if the credit report shows $0 as the monthly payment, then the qualifying monthly payment must be determined using one of the options below:\n· If the borrower is on an income-driven payment plan, student loan documentation may be obtained to verify the actual monthly payment is $0. The borrower may then qualify with a $0 payment.\n. For deferred loans or loans in forbearance, the following must be calculated:\no :unselected: A payment equal to 1% of the outstanding student loan balance (even if this amount is lower than the actual fully amortizing payment); or\no :unselected: Fully amortizing payment using the documented loan repayment terms; or\n:unselected: o If payments have been deferred for 12 months or greater from note date, then payment\ncalculation may be excluded from debt-to-income (DTI) ratio.\n6.13 TIMESHARES\nFor credit review purposes, timeshare obligations will be considered installment loans.\n6.14 UNDISCLOSED DEBTS\nIf asset statements provided reflect payments made on obligations not listed on the credit report or 1003, additional information must be obtained to determine if the liability should be included in the borrower's debt- to-income ratio.\nIf the obligation does not belong to the borrower, supporting documentation is required. If there is a non- borrower also on the account, a signed letter of explanation from the borrower is sufficient.\nIf the borrower is the obligor on the debt, an account statement and pay history should be obtained to review the account for acceptability. The payment must be included in the debt ratio.\n6.15 PACE LOANS\nProperties with solar panels financed with a PACE loans are ineligible unless paid through closing.

See the DSCR Program Matrix for LTVs available for each type.\n• DSCR ≥ 1.25\n· DSCR ≥ 1.15 < 1.25\n· DSCR ≥ 1.00 < 1.15\n· DSCR ≥ 0.75 < 1.00\n. If DSCR < 0.75 - SEE NO RATIO RATE SHEET/MATRICES\n8.2.8.5 DSCR (DEBT-SERVICE COVERAGE RATIO) ≥ 0.75\nA Debt-Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR) will be calculated for the subject property in lieu of documenting borrower income. Market rent must be documented with Form 1007 or Form 1025, as applicable.\nThe DSCR calculation is as follows:\nDebt-Service Coverage Ratio = Gross Income / Proposed PITIA*\nTo calculate Gross Income, use the lower of the (a) executed lease agreement or (b) market rent from Form 1007 or Form 1025, as applicable. If the executed lease agreement reflects a higher monthly rent, it may be used in the calculation when evidence of receipt of the higher amount for the 3 most recent, consecutive months is provided. Rents cannot exceed 120% of market rents reflected on Form 1007 or Form 1025.\nShort-Term vacation rentals are acceptable such as Airbnb or VRBO. For short-term rentals we will use an AIRDNA to calculate the DSCR or Form 1007 that clearly states short-term rentals are common for the neighborhood. In all circumstances, there will be a 20% expense factor used.\n1007/1025 May be used but must include all of the following:\n· Source of data used to compete the STR analysis.\n· Comparable STR properties, focusing on room count, gross living area (GLA), location, and market appeal.\n· Daily rental rate and occupancy percentage.\n· Seasonality and vacancy are factored into analysis\n· Must be completed by a licensed appraiser.\nAirDNA Criteria: Two individuals per room, minimum market/sub-market grade of 60, minimum 3 comps in the same zip code.\nCPN.BPA.BPD.BPN.rev20250325\nPage | 66\n\nARDRI\nARDRI NON-PRIME LOAN PROGRAM GUIDELINES\nIllustrative Calculation (guide only):\n. Use the lower of the monthly lease or market rents and multiply by 12= Annual gross income\n. Divide the gross annual income by the annual PITI or PITIH and arrive at the DSCR. If the DSCR fails to meet the above criteria Management may make discretionary concessions on the rate and or loan amount to help qualify the loan.\n· 1003 section is left blank, and no income verification is required.\n*For interest-only loans, the DSCR calculation allows for the use of the interest-only payment including escrows.\n8.3 EMPLOYMENT HISTORY\nEmployment must be stable with at least a 1-year history in the same job or jobs in the same field. Income from self-employment is considered stable if the borrower has been self-employed for the term of income choice.\n8.3.1 FREQUENT JOB CHANGES\nFrequent job changes to advance within the same line of work may be considered favorable. Job changes without advancement or in different fields of work should be carefully reviewed to ensure consistent or increasing income levels and the likelihood of continued stable employment.\n8.3.2 GAPS IN EMPLOYMENT\nGap of employment of 90 days or more is seen as a layering of risk.\n8.3.4 RE-ENTRY BACK INTO WORKFORCE\nRe-entry into the work force is considered when the Borrower(s) has been un-employed >12 months.

The full amount of the allowance must be added to the borrower's monthly income, and the full amount of the lease or financing expenditure to the borrower's monthly debt obligations.\n8.4.3 BONUS, OVERTIME, TIPS & COMMISSION\nA written Verification of Employment or Work number should be obtained to provide a breakdown of bonus, overtime, tips, or commission earnings for the most recent 1 year and YTD. If the VOE states the income is unlikely to continue, it may not be used in qualifying.

Income received for less than 6 months is considered unstable and may not be used to qualify the borrower. Also, if full or partial payments are made on an inconsistent or sporadic basis, the income is not acceptable for qualifying the borrower.\nNote: ARDRI expects TPO originating loans for the funding or sale to ARDRI to make appropriate disclosures, as required under the federal Equal Credit Opportunity Act, that child support, alimony, or maintenance income information need not be provided unless the borrower wants the lender to consider such income in underwriting the loan.\n8.4.6 COMMISSION INCOME\nCommission earnings should be averaged over the most recent 1 or 2 years and require the following\nCPN.BPA.BPD.BPN.rev20250325\nPage | 68\n\nARDRI\nARDRI NON-PRIME LOAN PROGRAM GUIDELINES\ndocumentation:\n.

For example, I- year 1099 = I year of employment ALT Doc. Current paystub and VOE with I year reported commission earnings = 1 year of employment full doc. Paystub and VOE with 2 years = 2 years of employment Full doc.\nA borrower(s) must be at their current job for at least 1 year with a minimum 1-year history of receiving commission in the same line of work may also qualify to use commission earnings.\nIf there are large fluctuations, the borrower must provide a signed, written explanation to support the increase or decrease in income. Additional supporting documentation is required to use commission income for qualification when documentation shows a decline in earnings from one year to the next.\nWith borrowers that receive a draw against the commission earnings, the draw income is not to be considered in addition to the commission income. Draws are only to be considered income paid in advance of receiving commissions, where the amount is then subtracted once the commissions are earned.\n8.4.7 DECLINING INCOME\nDeclining income sources should be closely reviewed to determine if the income may be used for qualifying purposes. Income showing a consistent decline over the prior years should not be considered as stable or usable income for qualification purposes.\nA signed, written explanation for the decline should be obtained from the borrower and/or employer. In instances where there is sufficient information to support the use of the income, the most recent lower income over the prior 2-year period must be used and may not be averaged.\n8.4.8 DISABILITY INCOME AND WORKMANS COMP\nLong-term and short-term disability income can be used for qualifications. The following documentation should be obtained for both long-term and short-term disability:\n.

Specific neighborhood characteristics include the following:\n· Degree of development\n· Demand and supply\n· Present land use\n· Owner-occupancy\nCPN.BPA.BPD.BPN.rev20250325\nPage | 96\n\nARDRI\nARDRI NON-PRIME LOAN PROGRAM GUIDELINES\n· Price range and predominant value\n· Age of subject property\n· Appeal to market and marketing time\n11.6.2 COMPATIBILITY OF SUBJECT PROPERTY AND NEIGHBORHOOD\nThe age and price of the subject property should be within the age and price ranges of properties in the subject neighborhood as reported on the URAR. Neighborhood factors indicating compatibility of the subject, such as present land use, predominant occupancy, and anticipated change in present land use are considered. Residential properties in areas that are zoned as either agricultural or commercial may be considered acceptable risks so long as their location does not impact marketability and require Sr. Management.\n11.6.3 PROXIMITY OF COMPARABLES TO SUBJECT PROPERTY\nWhenever possible, comparable sales in the same neighborhood as the subject property should be used. Sales prices of comparable properties in the neighborhood should reflect the same positive and negative location characteristics. Comparable sales beyond neighborhood boards, past major thoroughfares, and on other side of freeways require Sr. Management.\nFor properties in established subdivisions, condo projects or PUDs, comparable sales from within the same subdivision or project as the subject property must be used if the subdivision or project has resale activity. Use of comparable properties located outside of the established subject neighborhood must be explained in the appraisal analysis.\nFor properties in new subdivisions, condo projects or PUDs, the subject property must be compared to other properties in its general market area as well as to properties within the subject subdivision or project. The appraiser must select one comparable sale from the subject subdivision or project and one comparable sale from outside the subject subdivision or project. The third comparable sale can be from inside or outside of the subject subdivision or project, provided it is a good indicator of value for the subject property.\n11.6.4 AGE OF COMPARABLES\nAppraisals should contain comparable sales dated within 3 months of the report date. Comparable from 3 to 6 months are permitted on a limited basis with an explanation from the appraiser. Comparable older sales that are the best indicator of value for the subject property may be used if warranted. Value must be supported, and market acceptance demonstrated when older comparable are utilized.\n11.6.5 PROPERTY VALUES WITHIN MARKET AREA\nThe value of the subject property should be in line with the home prices in the subject's market area. The appraiser must report the primary indicators of market condition for properties in the subject neighborhood as of the effective date of the appraisal by noting the following:\nCPN.BPA.BPD.BPN.rev20250325\nPage | 97\n\nARDRI\nARDRI NON-PRIME LOAN PROGRAM GUIDELINES\n· The trend of property values\n· The supply of properties in the subject neighborhood\n· Targeting time for properties\nThe appraiser must provide their conclusions for the reasons a market is experiencing declining property values, an over-supply of properties, or marketing times over 6 months. In these circumstances, the appraisal value and LTV require Sr. Management.\n11.6.6 REDLINING PROHIBITION\nProhibited bases such as race, ethnicity, gender, minority geography or any other prohibited basis category should not be included as an appraisal factor or considered when reviewing an appraisal. As a matter of policy, appraisal reports which refer to a prohibited basis category (e.g., race or minority geography) are not acceptable. The use of code phrases as proxies for race which are not necessarily descriptive of value or risk is unacceptable. The information in the appraisal report must objectively support any statement or conclusion in the report.\n11.6.7 IMPROVMENTS AND OVER-IMPROVEMENTS\nImprovements must conform to the neighborhood in terms of age, type, design, and materials used for construction.\nAn over-improvement is an improvement that costs more than its contributory value within the marketplace. The appraiser must comment on over-improvements and indicate their contributory value in the \"sales comparison analysis\" adjustment grid. Improvements can represent an over-improvement for the neighborhood, but still be within the neighborhood price range-such as a property with an in-ground swimming pool, a large addition, or an oversized garage in a market that does not demand these kinds of improvements. Appraisals on properties with over-improvements that may not be acceptable to the typical purchaser must be reviewed to ensure that only the contributory value of the over- improvement is reflected in the appraisal analysis and require Sr. Management.\n11.7 VALUATION ANALYSIS\n11.7.1 SALES COMPARISON APPROACH\nEach appraisal must contain an estimate of market value. Market value is defined as the most probable price which a property should bring in a competitive and open market under all condition's requisite to a fair sale, the buyer and TPO each acting prudently and knowledgeably, and assuming the price is not affected by undue stimulus. Implicit in this definition are the consummation of a sale as of a specified date and the passing of title from Borrower to buyer under conditions whereby:\n· Buyer and Seller of property are typically motivated.\n· Both parties are well informed or well advised, acting in what they consider their best interest.\n· A reasonable time is allowed for exposure in the open market.\nCPN.BPA.BPD.BPN.rev20250325\nPage | 98\n\nARDRI\nARDRI NON-PRIME LOAN PROGRAM GUIDELINES\n· Payment is made in terms of cash in US dollars or in terms of comparable financial arrangements comparable.\n· The price represents the normal consideration for the subject property sold unaffected by special financing or sales concessions granted by anyone associated with the sale.\nA minimum of 3 to 6 closed comparables must be reported in the sales comparison approach. Additional comparable sales may be reported to support the opinion of market value provided by the appraiser. The subject property cannot be used as a comparable sale or as supporting data if it was previously closed. Contract offerings and current listings can be used as supporting data, if appropriate.\nComparable sales utilized in the market approach should:\n· Be within one mile of the subject property.\n· Be closed within the last 3 to 6 months, preferably sooner.\n· Indicate properties that are similar to the subject property with respect to age, size, features, amenities, etc.\n· Result in an overall net adjustment not exceeding 15% of the sales price of that comparable and a gross adjustment not exceeding 25% of the sales price of that comparable\n· Reflect adjustments for individual line items not exceeding 10%\n· Have a sales price that is within the general range of value as the subject.\n. Have at least 3 to 6 of the comparables should be recently closed sales. If the Appraiser cannot find comps within 3 to 6 months, comments from the Appraiser explaining the reasoning why no comps were available. Requires Sr. Management.\n11.7.2 UNDERWRITING REVIEW\nUnderwriter will analyze the Appraisal with the following information taken into consideration when evaluating the collateral used to secure the loan:\n· A rating of less than 25% built up usually indicates non-residential use and requires further detailed review of the Appraisal.\n· An oversupply of housing is an indication the subject's area may not be desirable and speculate a slow market or unmarkable property. A marketing time of 6 months is preferred, however on a case-by-case basis it may be acceptable so long as the Appraiser explains the reason no comps were available.\n· The Appraiser's statement along with form 1007 for market rents must be comparable to the rental properties used for comparison with the DSCR and Non-Owner-occupied products. Rental data should be supplied from other similar income producing properties that are similar in number of units, size, and room count. Rental comps must be in close proximity to the subject property. Choosing comparables outside the immediate area may reflect a lack of marketability.\n· The subject property should be close to the predominant value noted in the One Unit Housing section where the low, high, and predominant value is indicated. If the value is greatly differing from the subject property value, comments from the Appraiser are required.\n· Market rents must be stable or increasing and only analyzed for those loan products such as DSCR or Non-owner-occupied properties.\n11.7.2 COST APPROACH\nCPN.BPA.BPD.BPN.rev20250325\nPage | 99\n\nARDRI\nARDRI NON-PRIME LOAN PROGRAM GUIDELINES\nWhen completed, the cost approach must clearly segregate value attributed to land, outbuildings, etc. If the ratio of land value to total value exceeds 35%, an explanation from the appraiser may be required to demonstrate conformance with neighboring properties. See also 11.8.12 Land Value. Appraisals that rely solely on the cost approach as an indicator of market value are not acceptable.\n11.7.3 INCOME APPROACH\nWhen the income approach to value is used, the appraisal report must include the supporting comparable rental and sales data and the calculations used to determine the gross rent multiplier. Appraisals that rely solely on the income approach as an indicator of market value are not acceptable.\n11.7.4 VALUATION ANALYSIS AND FINAL RECONCILIATION\nIn the final reconciliation, appraisers must reconcile the reasonableness and reliability of each applicable approach to value along with validity of the indicated values. The appraiser must select and report the approaches that were given the most weight. An averaging technique cannot be used.\n11.7.5 APPRAISAL REVIEW PROCESS\nAn appraisal review product is required on every loan file unless a second appraisal is obtained. The appraisal review product should provide an \"as is\" value for the subject property (the \"Appraisal Review Value\") as of the date of the subject loan transaction.\nAcceptable review products include:\n·__ Collateral Underwriter® (CUR). An eligible score is 2.5 or less. The file must include a copy of the Submission Summary Report (SSR). If the score exceeds 2.5, the file must include an enhanced Desk Review.\n. Desk Review Results: with a confidence score of 90% or higher. If Confidence score is less than 90%, a- second appraisal will be required. o If CDA value to Appraised value is 0.0% to -10% variance and Risk Score is LOW - Use Appraised value\no If CDA value to Appraised value is -0.1% to -10% variance and Risk Score is MODERATE- Use lower of the two values\no If CDA value to Appraised value is over -10% variance- regardless of Risk Score - a 2nd Appraisal is required\no If Risk Score is HIGH or INDETERMINATE- regardless of CDA value to Appraised value variance - a 2nd appraisal is required\nIn all cases, the lower valuation of the two values will be used unless internal value is opined- by Senior Management. If Borrower or Broker wants to dispute the value, they can order aARDRI can order a 2nd appraisal through ACT AMC (paid for by Borrower or Broker) and once received, Senior Management will review all valuations and determine an internal value.\nFormatted: Superscript\nFormatted\nFormatted: Superscript\nCPN.BPA.BPD.BPN.rev20250325\nPage | 100",

Capital Alliance, LLC NMLS# 1243767.\nEQUAL HOUSING OPPORTUNITY\n8\n11/10/2025\n\nNon-Agency (Non-QM) - First Lien\nCHAPTER 1 - DOING BUSINESS WITH CAPITAL ALLIANCE\n1.1 GENERAL INFORMATION\nThis guide sets forth the eligibility guidelines to ensure each mortgage loan meets Capital Alliance's quality standards. A loan meets Capital Alliance quality standards if the legal documents, borrower's credit, income documentation, quality of the collateral (property), and compliance with all applicable laws are consistent with the loan program under the guide.\nCapital Alliance manually underwrites all loans in accordance with this guide. Capital Alliance's credit philosophy is a practical application of the guidelines when analyzing a loan. Our focus is on aligning the interest of the borrower and limiting layered risk through a combination of:\n· Verified employment, income, assets, and reserves.\n. Borrower credit and housing history.\n. Value of collateral used to secure the loan.\nExceptions to published guidelines are considered on a case-by-case basis. Loans requiring an exception are reviewed wholistically, taking into account the risk factors noted above. Regardless of the exception type, the loan should demonstrate strong compensating factors to support granting an exception. Capital Alliance's decision to close of any mortgage loan will be based on a full credit, compliance and property review.\nAny third-party originator or broker engaged with Capital Alliance must fully comply with all federal, state, and local laws applicable to the origination of mortgage loans (\"Applicable Law\").\n1.2 REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES & COVENANTS\nRepresentations, Warranties & Covenants are outlined in the Wholesale Broker Agreement.\n1.2.1 STATE LICENSING\nAny third-party originator or broker must comply with all applicable state license and registration requirements in connection with mortgage loan origination and any other related business activities.\n1.2.2 QUALITY CONTROL\nCapital Alliance applies its Quality Control Policy and Procedures to loans and requires that third-party originators and brokers have their own Quality Control Policy and Procedures in place. Capital Alliance performs regular reviews to ensure the quality of loans closed.\n9\n11/10/2025",

Accordingly, Capital Alliance will not discriminate on any prohibited basis. Capital Alliance will also not knowingly accept loan submissions from any third-party originators or brokers engaged in practices that violate Fair Lending Requirements. To the extent a third-party originator or broker is found to be engaging in practices that may violate Fair Lending Requirements, Capital Alliance may terminate its contractual relationship with such third-party originator or broker or take any other action that it deems appropriate.\n1.2.4 STATE AND FEDERAL HIGH-COST LOANS\nCapital Alliance does not close on loans that are subject to the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act of 1994 (HOEPA), also known as \"federal high cost\" mortgages.\nFurther, Capital Alliance does not close on mortgage loans that meet the definition of \"high cost,\" \"high risk,\" \"covered,\" \"subprime,\" or any similar designation under state or local law.\n1.2.5 ABILITY TO REPAY (ATR)\nAll loans subject to the general ATR underwriting standards (12 C.F.R 1026.43(c)) require a creditor to make a reasonable, good-faith determination that the consumer has a reasonable ability to repay the loan prior to or at consummation. A reasonable, good-faith ATR evaluation must consider the following eight underwriting factors based on available information in the mortgage loan file using reliable third-party records:\n. Income or assets used to repay the loan.\n· Employment status.\n. Monthly mortgage payment on the subject loan (fully indexed, fully amortizing).\n. Monthly payments for any simultaneous loans secured by the subject property.\n. Monthly payments for property taxes, hazard insurance, HOA fees, or ground rents.\n. Debts (reported by a credit bureau or disclosed by the consumer), alimony, and child support obligations.\n. Monthly DTI or residual income.\n· Credit history.\n1.2.6 FEE POLICY\nFees charged must be in compliance with all applicable requirements, including those governing permissible fees, maximum fee amounts, timing, and disclosures.\n10\n11/10/2025\n\nNon-Agency (Non-QM) - First Lien\n1.2.7 PREPAYMENT PENALTY\nPrepayment penalties are only eligible for investment properties under the Non-Agency program.

Specific information regarding rate locks, extensions, and renegotiations is provided as follows.\n1.3.3.1 GENERAL RATE LOCK INFORMATION\nCapital Alliance offers 30-day initial locks and 5, 10, and 15-day extensions.\n1.3.3.2 LOCKING LOANS\nRate Lock requests can be submitted to the Lock Desk Team once the loan is Lock Eligible. Lock Eligibility is determined by Capital Alliance Underwriters. At the earliest, loans become lock eligible for:\n. Borrower Income loans after the Conditional Loan Approval has been issued and appraisal has been ordered. In most cases, loans become Lock Eligible once the Borrower's income has been analyzed and a DTI has been determined\n. Property Cash Flow (DSCR) loans once the Appraisal (Form 1004) & Market Rent Survey (Form 1007) has been received and reviewed.\nRate Lock requests must be received by the Lock Desk Team by 3:00 PM (PT) and to include a Record of Business and Rate Sheet generated by LoanNEX, pricing engine. The Lock Desk Team aim to respond with Lock Confirmation within 1-2 hours, if submitted during the Lock Desk hours. If locks are submitted after Lock Desk hours, the Lock Desk Team may not be able to honor that date of submission's rate.\n1.3.3.3 RATE LOCK EXTENSIONS\n. Lock extensions are available for active locks. Expired locks may not be extended; they can only be relocked.\n. Locks may be extended for 5, 10, or 15 days.\nExtension Fee\n5 Days\n0.075\n10 Days\n0.150\n15 Days\n0.225\n.

Worse case pricing is determined by comparing the rate sheet from the lock date to the rate sheet from the relock date (current rates).\n. Loans relocked after 30 days from the lock expiration will be subject to Current Market Pricing. The ReLock Fee will not apply.\n1.3.4 NOTE AND SECURITY INSTRUMENT FORMS\nFor consumer loan transactions, the current version of the Uniform Residential Loan Application (URLA) should be used. For business purpose loan transactions, the URLA or similar application may be utilized. The minimum information required on a business purpose application includes: guarantor name, guarantor current address, social security number, and date of birth.\nAvailable Fannie Mae® security instruments, notes, riders/addenda, and special purpose documents can be used for owner-occupied or investment property loan documentation. The Fannie Mae® forms are available at https://singlefamily.fanniemae.com/selling-and-servicing-guide-forms-and-communications. In instances when Fannie Mae® doesn't offer current documentation (e.g., interest only), a document vendor, such as Doc Magic or Ellie Mae (ICE) should be used to obtain forms. The note should reflect a late charge assessment if payment is not received by the 15th day of each month. The late charge should equal the maximum allowed under state law not to exceed 5%.\nFor business purpose loans (Investment Property Only), Capital Alliance offers a business purpose document set consisting of: Note, Loan Agreement, Personal Guaranty, Prepayment Addendum and Prepayment Rider.\n1.3.5 HYBRID CLOSING\nCapital Alliance will allow loans to close using a Hybrid closing method.

Policies that limit, depreciate, reduce, or otherwise settle losses at anything other than replacement cost basis are also unacceptable.\nExtended coverage must include, at a minimum: wind, civil commotion (including riots), smoke, hail, and damage caused by aircraft, vehicle, or explosion.\nPolicies that limit or exclude from coverage (in whole or in part) windstorm, hurricane, hail damage, or any other perils that normally are included under an extended coverage endorsement are not acceptable. Borrowers may not obtain property insurance policies that include such limitations or exclusions unless they are able to obtain a\n15\n11/10/2025\n\nNon-Agency (Non-QM) - First Lien\nseparate policy or endorsement from another commercial insurer that provides adequate coverage for the limited or excluded peril, or from an insurance pool that the state has established to cover the limitations or exclusions.\nMinimum coverage amount of the insurance policy must cover at least equal to the lessor of:\n. Full replacement cost value of the improvements as of the current property insurance policy effective date, or\n. Total loan amount, provided it equals no less than 80% of the replacement cost value of the improvements as of the current property insurance policy effective date.\nThe source used to verify the coverage amount may be the property insurer, an independent insurance risk specialist, or other professional with appropriate resources to make such a determination. This may include, but is not limited to, a statement from the insurer or other applicable professional, a replacement cost estimator, or an insurance risk appraisal. If the coverage amount does not meet the minimum required, coverage that does provide the minimum required amount must be obtained.\nDeductible\nThe maximum deductible amount is based on the following:\n· 5% deductible for LTV > 80%\n· 10% deductible for LTV ≤ 80%\nCalculating the Amount of Required Coverage\nSteps to calculate the amount of required property insurance coverage are described in the following table:\nStep\nDescription\n1\nCompare the replacement cost value of the improvements to the unpaid principal balance (UPB) of the loan.\n1A\nIf the replacement cost value of the improvements is less than the UPB, the replacement cost value is the amount of coverage required.\n1 B\nIf the UPB of the loan is less than the replacement cost value of the improvements, go to Step 2.\n2\nCalculate 80% of the replacement cost value of the improvements.\n2A\nIf the result of this calculation is equal to or less than the UPB of the loan, the UPB is the amount of coverage required.\n2B\nIf the result of this calculation is greater than the UPB of the loan, this calculated figure is the amount of coverage required.\n16\n11/10/2025\n\nNon-Agency (Non-QM) - First Lien\nExamples for minimum property insurance coverage are provided in the following table:\nCategory\nProperty A\nProperty B\nProperty C\nReplacement Cost Value\n$90,000\n$100,000\n$100,000\nUnpaid Principal Balance (UPB)\n$95,000\n$90,000\n$75,000\n80% of Replacement Cost Value\n--\n$80,000\n$80,000\nRequired Coverage\n$90,000\n$90,000\n$80,000\n1.4.1.9 COMMERCIAL GENERAL LIABILITY INSURANCE: 2-8 MIXED USE PROPERTIES\nCommercial General Liability Insurance for 2-8 Mixed Use Properties is required in addition to Hazard Insurance. The effective date of the policy must be on or before the Note date.\nCommercial General Liability Insurance blanket policy against claims for personal injury, bodily injury, death, or property damage occurring upon, in or about any property, such insurance to be:\n. Per Occurrence Minimum Coverage: $1,000,000.\n· Aggregate Coverage: $2,000,000.\n. At least as broad as Insurance Services Office's (ISO) policy form CG 00 01.\n1.4.1.10 FLOOD INSURANCE\nThe property securing the mortgage loan must be adequately protected by flood insurance when required. The effective date of the policy must be on or before the Note date.\nFlood insurance coverage is required when a mortgage loan is secured by a property located in:\n· A Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA), or\n. A Coastal Barrier Resources System (CBRS) or Otherwise Protected Area (OPA). See below for additional information.\no Refer to Coastal Barrier Resources System Mapper at https://fwsprimary.wim.usgs.gov/CBRSMapper- v 2/.\nTo determine whether or not the property is located in an SFHA, a Standard Flood Hazard Determination form endorsed by FEMA is used. All flood zones beginning with the letter \"A\" or \"V\" are considered SFHAs.\n. If the subject property is located within a CBRS or an OPA, flood insurance is required regardless of whether the property is located in an SFHA.\nFor condominiums or attached PUDs with a master policy, see Section 2.9.6.9.4 - Master Flood Insurance\n17\n11/10/2025\n\nNon-Agency (Non-QM) - First Lien\n1.4.1.10.1 DETERMINING IF FLOOD INSURANCE IS REQUIRED ON SPECIFIC STRUCTURES\nThe following table describes how to evaluate a property to determine if flood insurance is required. For the purpose of these requirements, the \"principal structure\" is the primary residential structure on the subject property.\nIF ...\nTHEN FLOOD INSURANCE IS ...\nany part of the principal structure is located in an SFHA,\nrequired.\nthe principal structure is not located in an SFHA, but a residential detached structure attached to the land that serves as part of the security for the mortgage loan is located within the SFHA\nrequired for the residential detached structure.\nthe principal structure is not located in an SFHA, but a non- residential detached structure attached to the land that serves as part of the security for the mortgage loan is located within the SFHA\nnot required on either structure.\nthe principal structure is not located in an SFHA, but a detached structure attached to the land that does not serve as part of the security for the mortgage loan is located within the SFHA\nnot required on either structure.\nDeductible may not exceed the maximum deductible amount currently offered by NFIP.\nThe minimum amount of flood insurance required for first-lien mortgages is the lowest of:\n. 100% of the replacement cost of the insurable value of the improvements,\n. The maximum insurance available through the NFIP, or\n. The unpaid principal balance (UPB) of the loan (or loan amount at the time of origination).\nMinimum coverage must be equal to the dwelling coverage for hazard insurance, subject to the following:\n. 1-4 Unit Properties: If dwelling coverage for hazard insurance is greater than $250,000 then flood coverage must be $250,000 as this is the maximum allowed per FEMA.\n. 5+ Units Properties: If dwelling coverage for hazard insurance is greater than $500,000 then flood coverage must be $500,000 as this is the maximum allowed per FEMA.\n1.4.1.10.2 ACCEPTABLE FLOOD INSURANCE POLICIES\nThe flood insurance policy must be one of the following:\n· A standard policy issued under the NFIP; or\n. A policy issued by a private insurer as long as the terms and amount of coverage are at least equal to that provided under an NFIP policy based on a review of the full policy issued by a private insurer.\nA Policy Declaration page is acceptable proof of flood insurance.\n18\n11/10/2025\n\nNon-Agency (Non-QM) - First Lien\n1.4.1.10.3 FLOOD INSURANCE ESCROW REQUIREMENTS\n• Escrow accounts for flood insurance premiums are required for all loans secured by residential improved real estate.\n1.4.1.11 TITLE POLICY REQUIREMENTS\nThe title insurer and final title policy must conform to Fannie Mae® requirements as published in the most recent Fannie Mae Selling Guide. Access to the Fannie Mae Selling Guide is available at Title Insurance | Fannie Mae.\nEach loan transaction must include a preliminary title report dated within 60 days of Note Date. The preliminary title report must indicate that a final policy will be issued upon payment of the premium.\n1.4.1.11.1 TERMS OF COVERAGE\nThe title insurance policy must ensure the title is acceptable and that the mortgage represents a first lien on a fee simple estate in the property. The title policy must also list all other liens and reflect they are subordinate. The title insurance policy must be updated with Its Successors and/or Assigns ISAOA language. When the borrower is an Entity, the title insurance policy must provide protection regarding whether the signatories had the authority to validly execute the mortgage document. The policy should be written on one of the following forms:\n. The 2021 American Land Title Association (ALTA) standard form.\n. An ALTA short form if it provides coverage equivalent to the 2021 ALTA standard form.\n. In states in which standard ALTA forms of coverage are, by law or regulation, not used, the state- promulgated standard or short form which provides the same coverage as the equivalent ALTA form.\n1.4.1.11.2 EFFECTIVE DATE OF COVERAGE\nThe effective date of the title insurance coverage written on forms that do not provide the gap coverage included in the 2021 ALTA policies may be no earlier than the later of the date of the final disbursement of loan proceeds or the date the mortgage was recorded.\nBecause the 2021 ALTA forms provide protection for the time between loan closing and recordation of the mortgage, policies written on those forms may be effective as of loan closing.\n1.4.1.11.3 AMOUNT OF COVERAGE\nThe amount of title insurance coverage must at least equal the original principal amount of the mortgage.\n1.4.1.11.4 MORTGAGE ELECTRONIC REGISTRATION SYSTEM (MERS)\nIf a mortgage is registered with MERS and is originated naming MERS as the original mortgagee of record, solely as nominee for the Lender named in the security instrument and the note, and the Lender's successors and assigns, then the \"insured mortgage\" covered by the title insurance policy must be identified in the title insurance policy as the security instrument given to MERS, solely as nominee for the Lender and Lender's successors and assigns. However, under no circumstances may MERS be named as the insured of a title policy.\n19\n11/10/2025",

Adjustable-Rate Mortgage endorsement: ALTA Endorsement 6-06\n· Environmental protection lien endorsement: ALTA Endorsement 8.1-06 or equivalent state form providing the required coverage\nReferences are to the ALTA 2021 form of endorsement, but state forms may be used in states in which standard ALTA forms of coverage are, by law or regulation, not used, provided that those endorsements do not materially impair the protection to Capital Alliance. As an alternative to endorsements, the requisite protections may be incorporated into the policy.\n1.4.1.11.6 CHAIN OF TITLE\nAll files must contain a 24-month title history. Transfer date, price, and Buyer and Seller names should be provided for any transfers that occurred within the past 24-months.\n1.4.1.11.7 CONDOMINIUM OR PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENTS (PUD)\nThe title insurance policy for a condominium or PUD unit mortgage must describe all components of the unit estate.\nFor condominium unit mortgages, an ALTA 4-06 or 4.1-06 endorsement or its equivalent is required. For PUD unit mortgages, an ALTA 5-06 or 5.1-06 endorsement or its equivalent is required. These endorsements must be attached to each policy or incorporated into the text of the policy.\nIf the unit owners own the common areas of the project as tenants in common, the policy for each unit's mortgage must reflect that ownership.\nIf the homeowners' association (HOA) owns the common elements, areas, or facilities of the project separately, the title insurance on those areas must insure that ownership.\nThis title policy must show that title to the common elements, areas, or facilities is free and clear of any objectionable liens and encumbrances, including any statutory or mechanic's liens for labor or materials related to improvements on the common areas that began before the title policy was issued.\nThe title policy must protect Capital Alliance by insuring:\n. That the mortgage is superior to any lien for unpaid common expense assessments. (In jurisdictions that give these assessments a limited priority over a first mortgage lien, the policy must provide assurance that those assessments have been paid through the effective date of the policy.)\n. Against any impairment or loss of title of the first lien caused by any past, present, or future violations of any covenants, conditions, or restrictions of the master deed for the project. (It must specifically insure against any loss that results from a violation that existed as of the date of the policy.)\n. That the unit does not encroach on another unit or on any of the common elements, areas, or facilities. (The policy also must insure that there is no encroachment on the unit by another unit or by any of the common elements, areas, or facilities.)\n. That the mortgage loan is secured by a unit in a condominium project that has been created in compliance with the applicable enabling statutes.\n20\n11/10/2025\n\nNon-Agency (Non-QM) - First Lien\n. That real estate taxes are assessable and lienable only against the individual condominium unit and its undivided interest in the common elements, rather than against the project as a whole.\n. That the owner of a PUD unit is a member of the homeowners' association, and that the membership is transferable if the unit is sold.\n1.4.1.11.8 INTER VIVOS REVOCABLE TRUST\nA loan that has an Inter Vivos Revocable Trust as mortgagor, Capital Alliance must:\n. Determine that both the trust and the mortgage satisfy eligibility criteria and documentation requirements.\n. Determine that under the laws of the states in which it does business, it can originate mortgages to validly created inter vivos revocable trusts.\n. Complete a review of the mortgage documentation, applicable state law, and the trust documents to ensure that title insurers provide full title coverage without exceptions for the trust or the trustees for inter vivos revocable trusts in that state.\n1.4.1.11.9 TITLE EXCEPTIONS\nCapital Alliance will not close on a mortgage secured by property that has an unacceptable title impediment, particularly unpaid real estate taxes and survey exceptions.\nIf surveys are not commonly required in particular jurisdictions, an ALTA 9 Endorsement must be provided. If it is not customary in a particular area to supply either the survey or an endorsement, the title policy must not have a survey exception.\n1.4.1.11.10 MINOR IMPEDIMENTS TO TITLE\nTitle for a property that secures a conventional mortgage is acceptable even though it may be subject to the following conditions, which Capital Alliance considers minor impediments:\n. Customary public utility subsurface easements that were in place and completely covered when the mortgage was originated, as long as they do not extend under any buildings or other improvements.\n. Above-surface public utility easements that extend along one or more of the property lines for distribution purposes or along the rear property line for drainage purposes, as long as they do not extend more than 12 feet from the property lines and do not interfere with any of the buildings or improvements or with the use of the property itself.\n1.4.1.12 SOLAR PANELS\n1.4.1.12.1 PROPERTIES WITH SOLAR PANELS\nThe ownership and debt financing structures commonly found with solar panels are key to determining whether the panels are third-party owned, personal property of the homeowner, or a fixture to the real estate. Common ownership or financing structures include:\n· borrower-owned panels,\n· leasing agreements,\n21\n11/10/2025\n\nNon-Agency (Non-QM) - First Lien\n. separately financed solar panels (where the panels serve as collateral for debt distinct from any existing mortgage); or\n· power purchase agreements\nProperty with solar panels are eligible. If the borrower is, or will be, the owner of the solar panels (meaning the panels were a cash purchase, were included in the home purchase price, were otherwise financed and repaid in full, or are secured by the existing first mortgage), our standard requirements apply (for example, appraisal, insurance, and title).\nThe ownership and any financing structure of the subject property's solar panels must be determined in order to properly underwrite the loan and maintain first lien position of the mortgage. When financing is involved, Capital Alliance may be able to make this determination by evaluating the borrower's credit report for solar-related debt and by asking the borrower for a copy of all related documentation for the loan. The title report must also be reviewed to determine if the related debt is reflected in the land records associated with the subject property. If insufficient documentation is available and the ownership status of the panels is unclear, no value for the panels may be attributed to the property value on the appraisal unless obtains a UCC \"personal property\" search is obtained that confirms the solar panels are not claimed as collateral by any non-mortgage lender.\nA Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) financing statement that covers personal property and is not intended as a \"fixture filing\" must be filed in the office identified in the relevant state's adopted version of the UCC.\nCapital Alliance to ensure that the appraiser has accurate information about the ownership structure of the solar panels and that the appraisal appropriately addresses any impact to the property's value. Separately financed solar panels must not contribute to the value of the property unless the related documents indicate the panels cannot be repossessed in the event of default on the associated financing. Any contributory value for owned or financed solar panels must be noted in the Improvements Section of the Appraisal Report.\n1.4.1.12.2 REQUIREMENTS FOR PROPERTIES WITH SOLAR PANELS THAT ARE OWNED\nSolar panels purchased through financing may or may not include the real estate as collateral.\nFinanced and collateralized (UCC on title)\nThe solar panels are collateral for the separate debt used to purchase the panels, but they are a fixture to the real estate because a UCC fixture filing* has been filed for the panels in the real estate records (on title report).\nNote: A Notice of Independent Solar Energy Producer Contract on title is not to be treated as a UCC fixture filing *.\n•\n:unselected: Obtain and review the credit report, title report, appraisal, and/or UCC fixture filing*, related promissory note and related security agreement that reflect the terms of the secured loan\no Include the debt obligation in the debt-to-income ratio\n• Provided that the panels cannot be repossessed for default on the financing terms, instruct the appraiser to consider the solar panels in the value of the property (based on standard appraisal requirements)\n. Include the solar panels financing balance in the LTV/CLTV ratio calculation (if unable to obtain, utilize original balance). The UCC fixture filing* must be subordinated with one of the following.\no Subordination Agreement\no UCC Termination\n22\n11/10/2025\n\nNon-Agency (Non-QM) - First Lien\n. Debt obligation is to be included in debt-to-income ratio and LTV/CLTV unless proof is provided verifying the debt has been paid down to zero (UCC termination does not automatically verify the debt is paid off).\n. CLTA Endorsement 150-06 is not eligible to be used in lieu of a Subordination agreement or UCC Termination.\n*A fixture filing is a UCC-1 financing statement authorized and made in accordance with the UCC adopted in the state in which the related real property is located. It covers property that is, or will be, affixed to improvements to such real property. It contains both a description of the collateral that is, or is to be, affixed to that such property, and a description of such real property. It is filed in the same office that mortgages are recorded under the law of the state in which the real property is located. Filing in the land records provides notice to third parties, including title insurance companies, of the existence and perfection of a security interest in the fixture. If properly filed, the security interest in the described fixture has priority over the lien of a subsequently recorded mortgage.\nFinanced and collateralized (UCC not on title)\nThe solar panels are reported to be collateral for separate (non-mortgage) debt used to purchase the panels, but do not appear on the title report.\nNote: A Notice of Independent Solar Energy Producer Contract on title is not to be treated as a UCC fixture filing.\n• Obtain and review the credit report, title report, appraisal, related promissory note and related security agreement that reflect the terms of the secured loan\no Include the debt obligation in the debt-to-income ratio\n. Instruct the appraiser not to provide contributory value of the solar panels towards the appraised value because the panels are collateral for another debt\n. Do not include the panels in the LTV/CLTV ratio calculation\n. If a previously filed UCC was temporarily removed from title through a UCC termination, evidence must be provided that the UCC was paid in full otherwise the financed balance must be included in LTV/CLTV\nPACE (Property Assessed Clean Energy)\nPACE allows homeowners to finance energy improvements through an assessment in their annual property tax bills.\n. Properties with solar panels and other energy efficient items financed with a PACE loan are not eligible if the PACE loan is not paid in full prior to or at closing.\nPACE loans, in some cases, are also referred to as HERO loans.\no Any property tax statement that reflects PACE, HERO, or equivalent will require proof of payoff.\n. If loan proceeds are used to pay off the PACE loan, transaction will be considered cash out.\n1.4.1.12.3 REQUIREMENTS FOR PROPERTIES WITH SOLAR PANELS THAT ARE LEASED OR COVERED BY A POWER PURCHASE AGREEMENT\nIf the solar panels are leased from or owned by a third party under a power purchase agreement or other similar lease arrangement, the following requirements apply (whether to the original agreement or as subsequently amended).\n23\n11/10/2025\n\nNon-Agency (Non-QM) - First Lien\n:unselected: . Obtain and review copies of the lease or power purchase agreement.\n. The monthly lease payment must be included in the DTI ratio calculation unless the lease is structured to: o Provide delivery of a specific amount of energy at a fixed payment during a given period, and\no Have a production guarantee that compensates the borrower on a prorated basis in the event the solar panels fail to meet the energy output required for in the lease for that period.\n. Payments under power purchase agreements where the payment is calculated solely based on the energy produced may be excluded from the DTI ratio.\n. The value of the solar panels cannot be included in the appraised value of the property.\n. The value of the solar panels must not be included in the LTV/CLTV ratio calculation, even if a precautionary UCC filing is recorded because the documented lease or power purchase agreement status takes priority.\no A \"precautionary\" UCC filing is one that lessors often file to put third parties on notice of their claimed ownership interest in the property described in it.\n:unselected: o When the only property described in the UCC filing as collateral is the solar equipment covered by the lease or power purchase agreement, and not the home or underlying land, such a precautionary UCC filing is acceptable (and a minor impediment to title), as long as the loan is underwritten in accordance with this topic.\n. The value of the solar panels must not be included in other debt secured by real estate in the CLTV ratio calculation because the documented lease or power purchase agreement status takes priority.\n. The property must maintain access to an alternate source of electric power that meets community standards.\n. The lease or power purchase agreement must indicate that:\no Any damage that occurs as a result of installation, malfunction, manufacturing defect, or the removal of the solar panels is the responsibility of the owner of the equipment and the owner must be obligated to repair the damage and return the improvements to their original or prior condition (for example, sound and watertight conditions that are architecturally consistent with the home);\no The owner of the solar panels agrees not to be named loss payee (or named insured) on the property owner's property insurance policy covering the residential structure on which the panels are attached. As an alternative to this requirement, it may be verified that the owner of the solar panels is not a named loss payee (or named insured) on the property owner's property insurance policy; and\no In the event of foreclosure, the Capital Alliance or assignee has the discretion to:\n. Terminate the lease/agreement and require the third-party owner to remove the equipment;\n. Become, without payment of any transfer or similar fee, the beneficiary of the borrower's lease/agreement with the third party; or\n. Enter into a new lease/agreement with the third party, under terms no less favorable than the prior owner.\nCHAPTER 2 - FIRST LIEN ELIGIBILITY\nThe Non-Agency programs offer loans with features beyond the criteria established for Qualified Mortgages. Features include alternative income documentation for self-employed borrowers, interest only, and loan qualification for investment properties using the subject property cash flow. Non-Agency loans submitted to Capital Alliance must meet the criteria of the current published Eligibility Guide.\n24\n11/10/2025",

Rolling late payments are not considered a single event. Each occurrence of a contractual delinquency is considered individually for loan eligibility.\nThe credit report must be reviewed to determine the payment status of all reported mortgage accounts for the previous 12-months.\n55 11/10/2025\n\nNon-Agency (Non-QM) - First Lien\nIf a complete 12-month mortgage history is not reported on the credit report, one of the following must be used to complete the borrower's payment history:\n· Credit supplement; or\n.

(ie: delinquent 31 days is 1x30 late, delinquent 61 days is 1 ×60 late, etc)\nIf subject transaction is a refinance, mortgage payoff statement is required from the creditor/servicer:\n. Payoff statement that reflects late fees, deferred balance, or delinquent interest greater than 30 days are subject to housing history and/or credit event criteria. Transaction is to be considered cashout.\nFor DSCR transactions, mortgages not appearing on the credit report other than the primary residence or subject property, can be excluded from determining housing history eligibility.\n2.5.5.2 RENTAL VERIFICATION\nA 12-month rental history is required for all Capital Alliance programs when the borrower is renting their current primary residence. Payment history is to be verified through one of the following:\n· A verification of rent (VOR) completed by the landlord, or\n. Lease agreement and the borrower's Proof of payment for most recent 12 months (cancelled check, ACH payment, bank transfer/wire, or electric payment method.)\n2.5.5.3 DEPARTURE RESIDENCE\n.

The rental income must be documented with all the following:\no Market Rent Analysis, Single Family Comparable Rent Schedule (FNMA Form 1007).\n56\n11/10/2025\n\nNon-Agency (Non-QM) - First Lien\n:unselected: o Copy of a current lease.\n:unselected: o Evidence of receipt of security deposit and first month's rent.\n2.5.6 CONSUMER CREDIT\n2.5.6.1 INSTALLMENT DEBT\nInstallment debt is a monthly obligation with fixed payments and terms. Payments on installments must be included in the borrower's debt-to-income (DTI) ratio.\nPayments can be excluded if there are 10 or fewer monthly payments remaining to pay the debt in full. If the payment is substantial and exceeds 5% of the borrower's qualifying income, the overall transaction should be reviewed to ensure the remaining payments will not impact the borrower's ability to handle the new mortgage payment.\nInstallment debt paid in full or prior to closing can be excluded from the debt-to-income ratio. Supporting documentation, such as a credit supplement or direct verification from the creditor, must be obtained as evidence the debt has been paid in full.\n2.5.6.2 LEASE PAYMENTS\nLease payments must be considered as recurring monthly debt obligations and included in DTI ratio calculation. This is regardless of the number of months remaining on the lease. This is because the expiration of a lease agreement for rental housing or an automobile typically leads to either a new lease agreement, the buyout of the existing lease, or the purchase of a new vehicle or house.\n2.5.6.3 STUDENT LOANS\nIf a monthly student loan payment is provided on the credit report, that amount may be used for qualifying purposes. If the credit report does not reflect the correct monthly payment, the monthly payment that is on the student loan documentation (the most recent student loan statement) may be used to qualify the borrower. If the credit report does not provide a monthly payment for the student loan, or if the credit report shows $0 as the monthly payment, the qualifying monthly payment must be determined. For deferred loans or loans in forbearance, Capital Alliance may calculate:\n. a payment equal to 1% of the outstanding balance (even if this amount is lower than the actual fully amortizing payment), or\n. a fully amortizing payment using the documented loan repayment terms.\n2.5.6.4 DEFERRED INSTALLMENT DEBT\nDeferred installment debts must be included as part of the borrower's recurring monthly debt obligations. For deferred installment debts other than student loans, if the borrower's credit report does not indicate the monthly amount that will be payable at the end of the deferment period, copies of the borrower's payment letters or forbearance agreements must be obtained so that a monthly payment amount can be determined and used in calculating the borrower's total monthly obligations.\n57\n11/10/2025\n\nNon-Agency (Non-QM) - First Lien\n2.5.6.5 REVOLVING DEBT\nRevolving debt is open-ended debt in which the principal balance may vary from month to month. The minimum required payment, as stated on the credit report or current account statement, should be used to calculate the debt-to-income ratio. If no payment is stated on the credit report, the greater of $10 or 5% of the current balance should be included in the DTI ratio calculation. Revolving accounts can be paid off prior to or at closing in order to exclude the payment from the debt ratio. Supporting documentation, such as a credit supplement or direct verification from the creditor, must be obtained as evidence the debt has been paid in full.\nEquity lines of credit secured by real estate should be included in the housing expense. If the credit report does not show a minimum payment amount, 5% of the outstanding balance must be used and included in the DTI ratio calculation.\nAny non-mortgage account can be no more than 30 days delinquent at time of application, except for DSCR transactions. Any delinquent account must either be brought current or paid off at closing, except for DSCR transactions. All mortgage accounts must be current at application and remain paid as agreed through closing.\n2.5.6.6 AUTHORIZED USER ACCOUNTS\nAuthorized user accounts can be excluded from the debt-to-income ratio.\n2.5.6.7 OPEN 30-DAY CHARGE ACCOUNTS\nFor open 30-day charge accounts that do not reflect a monthly payment on the credit report, or 30-day accounts that reflect a monthly payment that is identical to the account balance, borrower funds to cover the account balance must be verified. The verified funds must be in addition to any funds required for closing costs and reserves.\n2.5.6.8 SOLAR PANELS\nInstallment debt from financed or leased payments associated with solar panels are to be included in the debt-to- income ratio. See Section 1.4.1.12- Solar Panels for additional criteria.\n2.5.6.9 TIMESHARES\nTimeshare obligations will be treated as a consumer installment loan.\n2.5.6.10 BUSINESS DEBT\nA business debt is a financial obligation of a business but may also be the responsibility of the business owner, making that person also liable for the debt. If the debt is reflected on the borrower's personal credit report, the borrower is personally liable for the debt, and it must be included in the debt-to-income ratio. When a self- employed borrower claims that a monthly obligation that appears on his or her personal credit report (such as a Small Business Administration loan) is being paid by the borrower's business, Capital Alliance to confirm that it verified that the obligation was actually paid out of company funds to exclude the debt.\nAny of the following supporting documentation can be included in the credit file to exclude business debt:\n58\n11/10/2025\n\nNon-Agency (Non-QM) - First Lien\n. Most recent six (6) months of cancelled checks, ACH payment, or transferred draw against the business account\n· Tax returns reflecting the business expense deduction\n. Business bank account statement showing assets remaining after funds to close and reserve requirements are deducted, with a balance greater than or equal to the balance of the debt.\nIf the debt is less than six (6) months old, the payment must be included in the DTI ratio.\n2.5.6.11 CONTINGENT LIABILITY ON COSIGNED OBLIGATIONS (DEBT PAID BY OTHERS) :unselected:\nContingent liability applies, and the debt must be included in the underwriting analysis, if an individual applying for a mortgage is a cosigner/co-obligor on:\n· Car loan\n· Student loan\n· Mortgage\n· Any other obligation\nIf proof is obtained that the borrower is not the party who is repaying the debt, the debt may be excluded. In order to exclude debts from the borrower's DTI ratio, the most recent 12-months canceled checks (or bank statements) from the other party making the payments that document a 12-month payment history with no delinquent payments must be obtained.\n2.5.6.12 COURT-ORDERED ASSIGNMENT OF DEBT\nWhen a borrower has outstanding debt which was assigned to another party by court order (such as under a divorce decree or separation agreement) and the creditor does not release the borrower from liability, the borrower has a contingent liability. The debt is not required to be counted as a contingent liability as part of the borrower's recurring monthly debt obligations.\nAfter the effective date of the assignment, the debt and payment history does not have to be considered as the borrower(s). Prior to the assignment, the borrower's debt and payment history must be considered.\n2.5.6.13 LOANS SECURED BY FINANCIAL ASSETS\nWhen a borrower uses his or her financial assets-life insurance policies, 401 (k) accounts, individual retirement accounts, certificates of deposit, stocks, bonds, etc .- as security for a loan, the borrower has a contingent liability.\nIt is not required to include this contingent liability as part of the borrower's recurring monthly debt obligations provided a copy of the applicable loan instrument that shows the borrower's financial asset as collateral for the loan be obtained. If the borrower intends to use the same asset to satisfy financial reserve requirements, the value of the asset (the account balance, in most cases) must be reduced by the proceeds from the secured loan and any related fees to determine whether the borrower has sufficient reserves.\nPayment on any debt secured by virtual currency is an exception to the above policy and must be included when calculating the debt-to-income ratio.\n59\n11/10/2025",

However, voluntary payments do not need to be taken into consideration and an exception is allowed for alimony. For alimony obligations, there is an option to reduce the qualifying income by the amount of the alimony obligation in lieu of including it as a monthly payment in the calculation of the DTI ratio.

Viable assets upon any reductions will be divided by sixty (60) months for the calculated qualifying monthly income. If funds are held in a retirement account (including but not limited to 401 (k), Roth IRA, etcetera), where liquidation would cause a potential taxable event. A reduction to the cash value is appropriate for the calculation based on the Applicant's age at time of Closing:\nApplicant's Age ≥59.5\n<59.5\nPercentage Utilized\n60%\n50%\nIn the event that the borrower has sufficient liquid assets to pay off the loan in full (\"ATR-in-Full\" program), Capital Alliance would consider this asset source as fulfilling the DTI / Residual income prong of the ATR test.

Net rent can never exceed $0 for determining impact.\nFor example, a property with a lease of $1,600 and PITIA of $1,500 would have $300 per month added to debt service ($1,600 x 75% less $1,500 = - $300). A lease of $2,400 and PITIA of $1,500 would have $0 per month added to the debt service ($2,400 x 75% = $1,800 less $1,500 = $300). Since the result is greater than $0, nothing is added to the debt service.\nEach rental property is countered separately. Other REO (including any rental properties) require additional reserves. Document at least 3 months receipt of rental income to utilize. If no rent can be documented for the property, include the full PITIA in its debt service.\n2.8 DEBT SERVICE COVERAGE (INVESTMENT PROPERTY)\nDebt Service Coverage Ratio transactions are available to experienced investors purchasing or refinancing investment properties for business purposes.

For guidance in the manual review of an appraisal report, see the Appraisal Review Guide.\nThe age and price of the subject property should fall within the age and price range of properties in the subject neighborhood. Comparable properties should be selected from the same neighborhood when possible. Selection of a comparable outside the subject neighborhood should be addressed within the report.

This inspection and the results of the analysis must be reported on the Appraisal Update and/or Completion Report (FNMA Form 1004D) and must be dated within 120 days of the Note date.\n. If the appraiser indicates on FNMA Form 1004D that the property value has declined, then a new appraisal for the property must be obtained.\n. If the appraiser indicates on FNMA Form 1004D that the property value has not declined, then additional fieldwork is not required.\nWhen the effective date of the original appraisal report is more than 365 days from the Note date (with an appraisal update), a new appraisal is still required.\nNot eligible: Properties for which the appraisal indicates condition ratings of C5 or C6, or a quality rating of Q6, as determined under the Uniform Appraisal Dataset (UAD) guidelines. Capital Alliance will consider if the issue has been corrected prior to loan funding and with proper documentation.\n2.9.1.1.3 SECOND APPRAISAL\nA second appraisal is required when any of the following conditions exist:\n. The loan balance exceeds $2,000,000 for either a single property loan or the allocated loan balance of a property within a cross-collateral loan.\no (2nd appraisal not required when Form 71A Multifamily or a commercial narrative report utilized).\n. The transaction is a flip as defined in the Property Flips section of this guide.\n. As required under the Appraisal Review Products section of this guide.\nWhen a second appraisal is provided, the transaction's \"Appraised Value\" will be the lower of the two appraisals. The second appraisal must be from a different company and appraiser than the first appraisal.\n2.9.1.1.4 APPRAISAL EVALUATION\nThe sales comparison approach must be used as the final appraised value. The sales comparison approach to value is an analysis of recent comparable sales that are most similar to the subject property. The appraiser must identify any differences that affect the opinion of value for the subject property as of the effective date of the appraisal report.\nThe appraiser's analysis of the subject and comparable sales must take into consideration all factors that influence value.\nSubject Analysis\n. Loans Vesting in an Entity: Borrower name disclosed on the appraisal report may reflect the individual member(s) of the entity or the entity name.\n100\n11/10/2025\n\nNon-Agency (Non-QM) - First Lien\nNeighborhood Analysis\n. Neighborhood boundaries should be described using four (4) cardinal directions, streets, waterways, other geographic features, and natural boundaries that define separation of one neighborhood from another.\n. Neighborhood characteristics should be described with types and sizes of structures, architectural styles, current land uses, site sizes, and street patterns or designs.\n. Factors that affect value and marketability should be mentioned in as much detail as possible - e.g., proximity of the property to employment and amenities, public transit, employment stability, market history, and environmental considerations.\n. Property improvements must constitute a legally permissible use of the land based on the zoning ordinance. If the improvements represent a legal, non-conforming use of property or has illegal or no local zoning, the appraisal analysis must reflect any adverse effect that the non-conforming use or zoning issues have on the value and marketability of the property; this requirement applies to all property types.\n. If there is a legal non-conforming (grandfathered) use, then the Borrower must provide a satisfactory verification from the local/government municipality that the property can be rebuilt to its current footprint if destroyed.\n. Special consideration must be given to properties that are subject to other types of land use regulations, such as coastal tideland or wetland laws, as setback lines or other provisions may prevent reconstruction or maintenance of the property improvements in the event of damage or destruction. The intent of some land- use regulations is to remove existing land uses and to stop land development (including the maintenance, or new construction, or seawalls) within specific setback lines. Except as stated above, properties with land- use restrictions which prohibit the reconstruction to maintenance the dwelling are ineligible.\nExisting Construction\n. If the appraiser reports the existence of minor conditions or deferred maintenance items that do not affect the safety, soundness, or structural integrity of the property, the appraiser may complete the appraisal \"as is.\" These items must be reflected in the appraiser's opinion of value.\n. When there are incomplete items or conditions that do affect the safety, soundness, or structural integrity of the property, the property must be appraised subject to completion of the specific alterations or repairs. These items can include a partially completed addition or renovation, or physical deficiencies that could affect the safety, soundness, or structural integrity of the improvements, including but not limited to, cracks or settlement in the foundation, water seepage, active roof leaks, curled or cupped roof shingles, or inadequate electrical service or plumbing fixtures. In such cases, a certificate of completion (Form 1004 D) from the appraiser must be obtained before the mortgage is closed.\n. Permanent and Functioning Heat Source - A permanent heat source is required except for properties located in geographic areas where it is typical not to have heat source and has no adverse effect on marketability.\nSubject Section\nThe appraiser is required to research and identify whether the subject property is currently for sale or if it has been offered for sale in the 12-months prior to the effective date of the appraisal. If the answer is 'No,' the data source(s) used must be provided. If the answer is 'Yes,' the appraiser must report on each occurrence or listing and provide the following information:\n· Offering price(s).\n101\n11/10/2025\n\nNon-Agency (Non-QM) - First Lien\n· Offering date(s).\n. Data source(s) used. For example, if the subject property is currently listed for sale and was previously listed eight months ago, the appraiser must report both offerings.\nActual and Effective Ages\nThere is no restriction on the actual age of the dwelling. Older dwellings that meet general requirements are acceptable. Improvements for all properties must be of the quality and condition that will be acceptable to typical purchasers in the subject neighborhood. The relationship between the actual and effective ages of the property is a good indication of its condition. A property that has been well-maintained generally will have an effective age somewhat lower than its actual age. On the other hand, a property that has an effective age higher than its actual age probably has not been well-maintained or might have a specific physical problem. In such cases, particular attention should be paid to the condition of the subject property in its review of any appraisal report. When the appraiser adjusts for the \"Year Built,\" he or she must explain those adjustments.\nAccessory Dwelling Units (ADU)\nAn Accessory Dwelling Unit (ADU) is an additional living area independent of the primary dwelling that may have been added to, created within, or detached from the primary dwelling. Examples of an ADU include, but are not limited to, a living area over the garage, a walk-out basement, or a small addition to the primary dwelling.\nCapital Alliance will lend on a one unit property with up to two ADUs.\nAccessory Dwelling Unit (ADU) Requirements:\n.

If it is determined that the property contains an ADU that is not allowed under zoning, the property is eligible, as follows:\n:unselected: o Hazard insurance replacement cost coverage must include the ADU.\n:unselected: Illegal use conforms to the subject neighborhood and market.\n:unselected: o Appraisal report demonstrates that improvements are typical for the market through an analysis of at least two comparable sales with the same non-compliant zoning use.\n. If an ADU can only be accessed through the primary dwelling or the area is open to the primary dwelling, it is not considered an ADU and is ineligible as an ADU.\nOther Requirements:\n. The property is defined as a one-unit property with up to two ADUs.\no Three or more ADUs on a single lot are not permitted.\n· Appraisal Report:\n102\n11/10/2025\n\nNon-Agency (Non-QM) - First Lien\n• Rental income may be used for the accessory unit subject to the following:\n:unselected: o Include a description of the ADU and analyze the effect it has on marketability of the subject property.\n:unselected: o Demonstrate that improvements are typical for the market through an analysis of at least one comparable property with the same use and same number of ADUs.\n:unselected: o Form 1025 must be completed when there are two ADUs.\n:unselected: o Appraisal report to reflect zoning compliance is legal or in compliance with zoning laws.\n:unselected: o Permits are to be verified if required by the jurisdiction.\n:unselected: o Appraisal report to include at least one comparable with the same number of ADUs as the subject property.\n:unselected: o Gross market rents must be itemized when there are two ADUs that generate rental income.\n:unselected: o Purchase Transactions:\n:unselected: .

If using AirDNA, total bedroom count should include both the primary dwelling and ADU(s).\nOutbuildings\nProperties with outbuildings must be given special consideration in the appraisal report review to ensure that the property is residential in nature. Descriptions of the outbuildings should be reported in the Improvements and Sales Comparison Approach sections of the appraisal report form.\nTYPE OF OUTBUILDING\nSUITABILITY\nMinimal outbuildings, such as small barns or stables, that have relatively insignificant value in relation to the total appraised value of the subject property\nThe appraiser must demonstrate, using comparable sales with similar amenities, that the improvements are typical of the residential properties in the subject area for which an active, viable residential market exists.\nAn atypical minimal building\nThe property is acceptable provided the appraiser's analysis reflects little or no contributory value for it.\nSignificant outbuildings, such as silos, large barns, storage areas, or facilities for farm-type animals\nThe presence of the outbuildings may indicate that the property is agricultural in nature. It must be determined whether the property is residential in nature, regardless of whether the appraiser assigns value to the outbuildings.\n103\n11/10/2025\n\nNon-Agency (Non-QM) - First Lien\nSolar Panels\nSolar panels that are leased from or owned by a third party under a power purchase agreement or other similar financing arrangement must be considered personal property and not be included in the appraised value of the property.

A reasonable, good-faith ATR evaluation must consider the following eight underwriting factors based on available information in the mortgage loan file using reliable third-party records:\n. Income or assets used to repay the loan.\n· Employment status.\n· Monthly mortgage payment on the subject loan (fully indexed, fully amortizing).\n· Monthly payments for any simultaneous loans secured by the subject property.\n· Monthly payments for property taxes, hazard insurance, HOA fees, or ground rents.\n· Debts (reported by a credit bureau or disclosed by the consumer), alimony, and child support obligations.\n. Monthly DTI or residual income.\n. Credit history.\n1.2 Exceptions & Items Not Addressed in this Guide\nUnless otherwise stated, Fannie Mae definitions, required documentation and underwriting guidelines should be followed. Additionally, while these Underwriting Guidelines are intended to be comprehensive, they may not encompass all specific loan or borrower scenarios.\nIn the event the underwriter determines an exception is warranted, the exception will be considered case by case, with compensating factors such as the below:\n. The borrower's residential payment history for 24 months is 0x30\n· 6 months reserves greater than the program required\n· FICO points greater than 20 points over required\n· DTI >10% below the program requirements or DSCR >1.15\n· LTV 10% below the maximum allowed\n. The borrower has additional income that is not used to qualify\nAll exceptions will be reviewed by the underwriting manager.\n1.3 Fair Lending\nFCM strictly complies with all applicable federal, state, and local requirements related to fair lending, including the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act (together, the \"Fair Lending Requirements\"). Accordingly, in connection with its decision to purchase loans, FCM will not discriminate on any prohibited basis. FCM will also not knowingly purchase loans from Sellers engaged in practices that violate Fair Lending Requirements. To the extent a Seller is found to be engaging in practices that may violate Fair Lending Requirements.\n1.4 Home Mortgage Disclosure ACT (HMDA)\nFCM will comply with the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA), including without limitation all data collection, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements.\n1.5 Higher Priced Mortgage Loan (HPML)\nIf a loan is Higher Priced Mortgage Loan as defined by the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau.\nHigher Priced Mortgage Loans are permitted with certain restrictions:\n· Escrow accounts are required.\n. A Full Interior/Exterior Appraisal is required to include a certification from the appraiser indicating that the appraisal was prepared in accordance with the requirements of title XI of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989, as amended (12 U.S.C. 3331 ET SEQ.), and any implementing regulations.\n· On a purchase transaction, a second appraisal is required if:\nPage 7 of 79\n@ 2024 First Colony Mortgage Corporation.

Note that the timelines are measured from the date the seller became the legal owner of the property and the date all parties signed the purchase agreement.\n. If the seller acquired the property through the following methods, a second appraisal is not required:\n- Bridge loans (for 12 months or less),\n- Reverse mortgages,\n- Loans for the initial construction of a dwelling - note that this is for a true construction loan, not for the end loan purchase of a newly constructed property,\n- A local, state, or federal government agency,\n- Through a foreclosure or deed in lieu, or\n- Inheritance or through a dissolution of marriage, civil union or domestic partnership, or through the partition of the seller's joint or marital assets.\n1.6 Maximum Interest Credit\nFCM will allow an interest credit through the 5th of the month.\n1.7 Assumability\nLoans are not assumable, regardless of loan program.\n1.8 Net Tangible Benefit\nUnless the mortgage loan is being originated as a Business Purpose loan, originators must ensure the transaction provides a net tangible benefit to the borrower(s). Examples of tangible benefits include but are not limited to:\n· financing the acquisition of a property\n· reducing the cash expenditure required to service an existing mortgage\n· lowering the interest rate of an existing mortgage\n· extending the period during which the interest rate on an existing mortgage is fixed\n· extending the term of an existing mortgage\n· obtaining additional cash proceeds through a cash-out refinance.\nThe tangible benefit provided to the borrowers by the Loan must exceed the borrowers' cost to acquire the Loan.\n1.9 Quality Control\nFCM applies its Quality Control Policy and Procedures to loans originated, ensuring the quality of loans for underwiring, compliance purposes.\n1.10 Qualified Mortgage\nThe Sharp Advantage loan programs are structured as Non-Qualified Mortgage (Non-QM) therefore QM Safe harbor or Rebuttable Presumption requirements do not apply, but rather still must meet the ability to repay standard.\n1.11 Regulatory Compliance\nAll loans originated by FCM will be in compliance with all federal, state, and local laws including without limitation, all statutes, regulations, ordinances, administrative rules, and orders that have the effect of law, and judicial rulings and opinions, that apply to any of their origination, selling, or servicing practices or other business practices and related technology. FCM will comply with any applicable law that addresses fair housing, fair lending, equal credit opportunity, truth in lending, wrongful discrimination, appraisals, real estate settlement procedures, borrower privacy, data security, escrow account administration, mortgage insurance cancellation, debt collection, credit reporting, electronic signatures or transactions, predatory lending, anti-money laundering, terrorist activity, ability to repay, state community and marital property, or the enforcement of any of the terms of the mortgage.

Banking Law § 6-M (New York Subprime), FCM does not purchase mortgage loans that meet the definition of \"high cost,\" \"high risk,\" \"covered,\" \"subprime,\" or any similar designation under state or local law.\nNew York Subprime Definition:\nSubprime home loan means a home loan in which the initial interest rate or the fully-indexed rate, whichever is higher, exceeds by more than one and three-quarters percentage points for a first-lien loan, or by more than three and three- quarters percentage points for a subordinate-lien loan, the average commitment rate for loans in the northeast region with a comparable duration to the duration of such home loan, as published by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (herein \"Freddie Mac\") in its weekly Primary Mortgage Market Survey (PMMS) posted in the week prior to the week in which the lender provides the Loan Estimate.\n1.13 State Licensing\nFCM will comply with all applicable state licenses and registration requirements in connection with mortgage loan origination and any other related business activities, which include without limitation:\n· Ensuring that each loan officer/originator/broker involved in the origination of loans are appropriately licensed.\n· Maintaining appropriate organizational licensure based on type and location of the activities it engages in.\n1.14 TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosure (TRID)\nAll loans must comply with TRID rules except for loans originated solely for business purposes, as defined in 12 CFR 1026.3(a)(1)of Regulation Z.\nAs used in this Guide, a \"Business Purpose Loan\" means a loan:\n· Single Family Non-Owner Occupied: To acquire, improve or maintain rental property (regardless of the number of housing units) that is not owner-occupied. This includes, for example, a single-family house that will be rented to another person to live in. If the owner expects to occupy the property for more than 14 days during the coming year, the property cannot be considered non-owner-occupied, and this special rule will not apply. For example, a beach house that the owner will occupy for a month in the coming summer and rent out the rest of the year is owner occupied and is not Business Purpose Loan.\n. Loans meeting this definition of \"Business Purpose\" are not subject to ability to repay and TRID disclosure requirements; borrower(s) must affirm the purpose of the loan by executing a Business Purpose and Occupancy Affidavit or a similar form. If a Business Purpose disclosure is not in the file, then the merits of the file must indicate that the loan meets the definition of a Business Purpose loan.\n· Special rules also apply to Business Purpose loans where the borrower is taking cash out of the transaction. In such situations, the cash being taken out must also be used for a Business Purpose and not for personal or consumer use.

In order to induce Lender to make the Loan evidenced by the Note for the benefit of Borrower, Guarantor is willing to guarantee and become surety for the performance by Borrower of its obligations under the Loan Documents, as more particularly described herein.

A reasonable, good-faith ATR evaluation must consider the following eight underwriting factors based on available information in the mortgage loan file using reliable third-party records:\n. Income or assets used to repay the loan.\n· Employment status.\n· Monthly mortgage payment on the subject loan (fully indexed, fully amortizing).\n· Monthly payments for any simultaneous loans secured by the subject property.\n· Monthly payments for property taxes, hazard insurance, HOA fees, or ground rents.\n· Debts (reported by a credit bureau or disclosed by the consumer), alimony, and child support obligations.\n. Monthly DTI or residual income.\n. Credit history.\n1.2 Exceptions & Items Not Addressed in this Guide\nUnless otherwise stated, Fannie Mae definitions, required documentation and underwriting guidelines should be followed. Additionally, while these Underwriting Guidelines are intended to be comprehensive, they may not encompass all specific loan or borrower scenarios.\nIn the event the underwriter determines an exception is warranted, the exception will be considered case by case, with compensating factors such as the below:\n. The borrower's residential payment history for 24 months is 0x30\n· 6 months reserves greater than the program required\n· FICO points greater than 20 points over required\n· DTI >10% below the program requirements or DSCR >1.15\n· LTV 10% below the maximum allowed\n. The borrower has additional income that is not used to qualify\nAll exceptions will be reviewed by the underwriting manager.\n1.3 Fair Lending\nFCM strictly complies with all applicable federal, state, and local requirements related to fair lending, including the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act (together, the \"Fair Lending Requirements\"). Accordingly, in connection with its decision to purchase loans, FCM will not discriminate on any prohibited basis. FCM will also not knowingly purchase loans from Sellers engaged in practices that violate Fair Lending Requirements. To the extent a Seller is found to be engaging in practices that may violate Fair Lending Requirements.\n1.4 Home Mortgage Disclosure ACT (HMDA)\nFCM will comply with the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA), including without limitation all data collection, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements.\n1.5 Higher Priced Mortgage Loan (HPML)\nIf a loan is Higher Priced Mortgage Loan as defined by the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau.\nHigher Priced Mortgage Loans are permitted with certain restrictions:\n· Escrow accounts are required.\n.

Note that the timelines are measured from the date the seller became the legal owner of the property and the date all parties signed the purchase agreement.\n. If the seller acquired the property through the following methods, a second appraisal is not required:\n- Bridge loans (for 12 months or less),\n- Reverse mortgages,\n- Loans for the initial construction of a dwelling - note that this is for a true construction loan, not for the end loan purchase of a newly constructed property,\n- A local, state, or federal government agency,\n- Through a foreclosure or deed in lieu, or\n- Inheritance or through a dissolution of marriage, civil union or domestic partnership, or through the partition of the seller's joint or marital assets.\n1.6 Maximum Interest Credit\nFCM will allow an interest credit through the 5th of the month.\n1.7 Assumability\nLoans are not assumable, regardless of loan program.\n1.8 Net Tangible Benefit\nUnless the mortgage loan is being originated as a Business Purpose loan, originators must ensure the transaction provides a net tangible benefit to the borrower(s). Examples of tangible benefits include but are not limited to:\n· financing the acquisition of a property\n· reducing the cash expenditure required to service an existing mortgage\n· lowering the interest rate of an existing mortgage\n· extending the period during which the interest rate on an existing mortgage is fixed\n· extending the term of an existing mortgage\n· obtaining additional cash proceeds through a cash-out refinance.\nThe tangible benefit provided to the borrowers by the Loan must exceed the borrowers' cost to acquire the Loan.\n1.9 Quality Control\nFCM applies its Quality Control Policy and Procedures to loans originated, ensuring the quality of loans for underwiring, compliance purposes.\n1.10 Qualified Mortgage\nThe Sharp Advantage loan programs are structured as Non-Qualified Mortgage (Non-QM) therefore QM Safe harbor or Rebuttable Presumption requirements do not apply, but rather still must meet the ability to repay standard.\n1.11 Regulatory Compliance\nAll loans originated by FCM will be in compliance with all federal, state, and local laws including without limitation, all statutes, regulations, ordinances, administrative rules, and orders that have the effect of law, and judicial rulings and opinions, that apply to any of their origination, selling, or servicing practices or other business practices and related technology.

Banking Law § 6-M (New York Subprime), FCM does not purchase mortgage loans that meet the definition of \"high cost,\" \"high risk,\" \"covered,\" \"subprime,\" or any similar designation under state or local law.\nNew York Subprime Definition:\nSubprime home loan means a home loan in which the initial interest rate or the fully-indexed rate, whichever is higher, exceeds by more than one and three-quarters percentage points for a first-lien loan, or by more than three and three- quarters percentage points for a subordinate-lien loan, the average commitment rate for loans in the northeast region with a comparable duration to the duration of such home loan, as published by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (herein \"Freddie Mac\") in its weekly Primary Mortgage Market Survey (PMMS) posted in the week prior to the week in which the lender provides the Loan Estimate.\n1.13 State Licensing\nFCM will comply with all applicable state licenses and registration requirements in connection with mortgage loan origination and any other related business activities, which include without limitation:\n· Ensuring that each loan officer/originator/broker involved in the origination of loans are appropriately licensed.\n· Maintaining appropriate organizational licensure based on type and location of the activities it engages in.\n1.14 TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosure (TRID)\nAll loans must comply with TRID rules except for loans originated solely for business purposes, as defined in 12 CFR 1026.3(a)(1)of Regulation Z.\nAs used in this Guide, a \"Business Purpose Loan\" means a loan:\n· Single Family Non-Owner Occupied: To acquire, improve or maintain rental property (regardless of the number of housing units) that is not owner-occupied. This includes, for example, a single-family house that will be rented to another person to live in. If the owner expects to occupy the property for more than 14 days during the coming year, the property cannot be considered non-owner-occupied, and this special rule will not apply. For example, a beach house that the owner will occupy for a month in the coming summer and rent out the rest of the year is owner occupied and is not Business Purpose Loan.\n. Loans meeting this definition of \"Business Purpose\" are not subject to ability to repay and TRID disclosure requirements; borrower(s) must affirm the purpose of the loan by executing a Business Purpose and Occupancy Affidavit or a similar form. If a Business Purpose disclosure is not in the file, then the merits of the file must indicate that the loan meets the definition of a Business Purpose loan.\n· Special rules also apply to Business Purpose loans where the borrower is taking cash out of the transaction. In such situations, the cash being taken out must also be used for a Business Purpose and not for personal or consumer use. This includes, for example, using the cash-out of the transaction to improve or maintain other rental properties owned by a borrower. An example of an impermissible use would include using the cash-out of transaction to pay for college tuition or personal debt (i.e., for a non-business purpose).\n. All DSCR loans are \"Business Purpose Loans\"; therefore, to be eligible for the product, the owner cannot occupy the property at any time during the coming year and all cash out proceeds must only be used for business purposes (e.g., acquisition/maintenance/improvement of rental properties).\n1.15 OFAC Search\nThe Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) of the US Department of Treasury administers and enforces economic and trade sanctions based on US foreign policy and national security goals against individuals and foreign countries. A clear OFAC search for individuals and foreign countries is required.\n· Individuals:\n@ 2024 First Colony Mortgage Corporation. NMLS #3112.

However, the appraiser is no qualified to detect such substances. The presence of substances such as asbestos, urea-formaldehyde foam insulation or other potentially hazardous materials may affect the value of the property. The value conclusions in this report are predicated on the assumption that there is no such materials on or in the property that would cause a loss of value. No responsibility is assumed for any such conditions, or for the expertise required to discover them. The client is urged to retain an expert in this field if desired. The analysis and value conclusions in this report are null and void should any hazardous material be discovered.\n8.

The borrower's ability to repay must be proven in all instances.\nLoans eligible for sale to a Government Sponsored Entity (Federal National Mortgage Association (\"Fannie Mae\" or “FNMA\") or Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (\"Freddie Mac\" or \"FHLMC\") are not eligible for the Alt-QM programs.\nFor any guideline not addressed in these guides, defer to Fannie Mae Guidelines.\nChange Home Mortgage - Alt Doc Express 08/08/2025\n4 | Page",

Implicit in this definition is the execution of a lease as of a specified date under conditions whereby\nLessee and lessor are typically motivated; Both parties are well informed or well advised, and acting in what they consider their best interests;\nPayment is made in terms of cash or in terms of financial arrangements comparable thereto; and\nThe rent reflects specified terms and conditions, such as permitted uses, use restrictions, expense obligations, duration, concessions, rental adjustments and revaluations, renewal and purchase options, and tenant improvements(Tls). (The Dictionary of Real Estate Appraisal. 7th ed., 2022. pp. 116-117) STATEMENT OF ASSUMPTIONS AND LIMITING CONDITIONS: The intended use of the Market Rent Analysis is to be a screening tool for collateral evaluation involving a financial lending institution.

The property description supplied to an used by the appraiser is assumed to be correct. Where property addresses and other incomplete descriptions were supplied and falling short of complete legal descriptions, the appraiser used property tax records, local property data services and other resources available to determine an adequate property description for purposes of performing the market rent analysis. The appraiser assumes no responsibility for damages resulting from inadequate property descriptions by the client.\n2. No survey of the property has been made or reviewed by the appraiser, and no responsibility is assumed in connection with such matters. Illustrative material, including photos, maps, plots, plans, utilized in this report are inclusive only to assist the reader in visualizing the property.

Property titles are assumed to be good and merchantable unless otherwise stated.\n4. Information furnished by others is believed to be true, correct, and reliable. However, no responsibility for its accuracy is assumed by the appraiser.\n5.

It is assumed that there are no hidden or unapparent conditions of the property, subsoil, or structures which would render the property more or less valuable. No responsibility is assumed for such conditions or for arranging for engineering studies which may be required to discover them.\n7. Unless otherwise stated in this report, the existence of hazardous material, which may or may not be present on the property, was not observed by the appraiser. However, the appraiser is no qualified to detect such substances. The presence of substances such as asbestos, urea-formaldehyde foam insulation or other potentially hazardous materials may affect the value of the property. The value conclusions in this report are predicated on the assumption that there is no such materials on or in the property that would cause a loss of value. No responsibility is assumed for any such conditions, or for the expertise required to discover them. The client is urged to retain an expert in this field if desired. The analysis and value conclusions in this report are null and void should any hazardous material be discovered.\n8. Unless otherwise stated in this report, no environmental impact studies were either requested or made in conjunction with this report. The appraiser reserves the right to alter, amend, revise, or rescind any opinions of value based upon any subsequent environmental impact studies, research, or investigation, all without penalty.\n9.

The appraiser was available to perform a complete interior inspection of the subject property. In the event such an inspection was not possible: and or if a limited inspection ws performed or no inspection was performed, this market rent analysis shall so state. In cases where the appraiser was limited in his ability to perform a thorough property inspection, assumptions were made using the best information available to him or her at the time, relative to improvement size, quality, condition, use; and physical attributes of the land and improvements. For purposes of the analysis these assumptions became matters of fact and were used as such. The appraiser shall not be held liable for conditions not apparent to him or her, and assumes no liability for damages occurring there from, when the inspection opportunities were limited.\n17.

A thorough review of the title report in these cases is required as well as the payment history pattern (VOM on the Seller's mortgage).\nInterested Party Transaction\nA Conflict-Of-Interest Transaction occurs when the borrower has an affiliation or relationship with the Mortgage Broker, Loan Officer, Real Estate Broker or Agent, or any other interested party to the transaction. In the case of the Mortgage Broker, Loan Officer, or Real Estate Broker/Agent extra due diligence must be exercised.

A reasonable, good-faith ATR evaluation must consider the following eight underwriting factors based on available information in the mortgage loan file using reliable third-party records:\n. Income or assets used to repay the loan.\n· Employment status.\n· Monthly mortgage payment on the subject loan (fully indexed, fully amortizing).\n· Monthly payments for any simultaneous loans secured by the subject property.\n· Monthly payments for property taxes, hazard insurance, HOA fees, or ground rents.\n· Debts (reported by a credit bureau or disclosed by the consumer), alimony, and child support obligations.\n. Monthly DTI or residual income.\n. Credit history.\n1.2 Exceptions & Items Not Addressed in this Guide\nUnless otherwise stated, Fannie Mae definitions, required documentation and underwriting guidelines should be followed. Additionally, while these Underwriting Guidelines are intended to be comprehensive, they may not encompass all specific loan or borrower scenarios.\nIn the event the underwriter determines an exception is warranted, the exception will be considered case by case, with compensating factors such as the below:\n. The borrower's residential payment history for 24 months is 0x30\n· 6 months reserves greater than the program required\n· FICO points greater than 20 points over required\n· DTI >10% below the program requirements or DSCR >1.15\n· LTV 10% below the maximum allowed\n. The borrower has additional income that is not used to qualify\nAll exceptions will be reviewed by the underwriting manager.\n1.3 Fair Lending\nFCM strictly complies with all applicable federal, state, and local requirements related to fair lending, including the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act (together, the \"Fair Lending Requirements\"). Accordingly, in connection with its decision to purchase loans, FCM will not discriminate on any prohibited basis. FCM will also not knowingly purchase loans from Sellers engaged in practices that violate Fair Lending Requirements. To the extent a Seller is found to be engaging in practices that may violate Fair Lending Requirements.\n1.4 Home Mortgage Disclosure ACT (HMDA)\nFCM will comply with the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA), including without limitation all data collection, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements.\n1.5 Higher Priced Mortgage Loan (HPML)\nIf a loan is Higher Priced Mortgage Loan as defined by the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau.\nHigher Priced Mortgage Loans are permitted with certain restrictions:\n· Escrow accounts are required.\n. A Full Interior/Exterior Appraisal is required to include a certification from the appraiser indicating that the appraisal was prepared in accordance with the requirements of title XI of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989, as amended (12 U.S.C. 3331 ET SEQ.), and any implementing regulations.\n· On a purchase transaction, a second appraisal is required if:\nPage 7 of 79\n@ 2024 First Colony Mortgage Corporation.

Note that the timelines are measured from the date the seller became the legal owner of the property and the date all parties signed the purchase agreement.\n. If the seller acquired the property through the following methods, a second appraisal is not required:\n- Bridge loans (for 12 months or less),\n- Reverse mortgages,\n- Loans for the initial construction of a dwelling - note that this is for a true construction loan, not for the end loan purchase of a newly constructed property,\n- A local, state, or federal government agency,\n- Through a foreclosure or deed in lieu, or\n- Inheritance or through a dissolution of marriage, civil union or domestic partnership, or through the partition of the seller's joint or marital assets.\n1.6 Maximum Interest Credit\nFCM will allow an interest credit through the 5th of the month.\n1.7 Assumability\nLoans are not assumable, regardless of loan program.\n1.8 Net Tangible Benefit\nUnless the mortgage loan is being originated as a Business Purpose loan, originators must ensure the transaction provides a net tangible benefit to the borrower(s). Examples of tangible benefits include but are not limited to:\n· financing the acquisition of a property\n· reducing the cash expenditure required to service an existing mortgage\n· lowering the interest rate of an existing mortgage\n· extending the period during which the interest rate on an existing mortgage is fixed\n· extending the term of an existing mortgage\n· obtaining additional cash proceeds through a cash-out refinance.\nThe tangible benefit provided to the borrowers by the Loan must exceed the borrowers' cost to acquire the Loan.\n1.9 Quality Control\nFCM applies its Quality Control Policy and Procedures to loans originated, ensuring the quality of loans for underwiring, compliance purposes.\n1.10 Qualified Mortgage\nThe Sharp Advantage loan programs are structured as Non-Qualified Mortgage (Non-QM) therefore QM Safe harbor or Rebuttable Presumption requirements do not apply, but rather still must meet the ability to repay standard.\n1.11 Regulatory Compliance\nAll loans originated by FCM will be in compliance with all federal, state, and local laws including without limitation, all statutes, regulations, ordinances, administrative rules, and orders that have the effect of law, and judicial rulings and opinions, that apply to any of their origination, selling, or servicing practices or other business practices and related technology. FCM will comply with any applicable law that addresses fair housing, fair lending, equal credit opportunity, truth in lending, wrongful discrimination, appraisals, real estate settlement procedures, borrower privacy, data security, escrow account administration, mortgage insurance cancellation, debt collection, credit reporting, electronic signatures or transactions, predatory lending, anti-money laundering, terrorist activity, ability to repay, state community and marital property, or the enforcement of any of the terms of the mortgage.

Banking Law § 6-M (New York Subprime), FCM does not purchase mortgage loans that meet the definition of \"high cost,\" \"high risk,\" \"covered,\" \"subprime,\" or any similar designation under state or local law.\nNew York Subprime Definition:\nSubprime home loan means a home loan in which the initial interest rate or the fully-indexed rate, whichever is higher, exceeds by more than one and three-quarters percentage points for a first-lien loan, or by more than three and three- quarters percentage points for a subordinate-lien loan, the average commitment rate for loans in the northeast region with a comparable duration to the duration of such home loan, as published by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (herein \"Freddie Mac\") in its weekly Primary Mortgage Market Survey (PMMS) posted in the week prior to the week in which the lender provides the Loan Estimate.\n1.13 State Licensing\nFCM will comply with all applicable state licenses and registration requirements in connection with mortgage loan origination and any other related business activities, which include without limitation:\n· Ensuring that each loan officer/originator/broker involved in the origination of loans are appropriately licensed.\n· Maintaining appropriate organizational licensure based on type and location of the activities it engages in.\n1.14 TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosure (TRID)\nAll loans must comply with TRID rules except for loans originated solely for business purposes, as defined in 12 CFR 1026.3(a)(1)of Regulation Z.\nAs used in this Guide, a \"Business Purpose Loan\" means a loan:\n· Single Family Non-Owner Occupied: To acquire, improve or maintain rental property (regardless of the number of housing units) that is not owner-occupied. This includes, for example, a single-family house that will be rented to another person to live in. If the owner expects to occupy the property for more than 14 days during the coming year, the property cannot be considered non-owner-occupied, and this special rule will not apply. For example, a beach house that the owner will occupy for a month in the coming summer and rent out the rest of the year is owner occupied and is not Business Purpose Loan.\n. Loans meeting this definition of \"Business Purpose\" are not subject to ability to repay and TRID disclosure requirements; borrower(s) must affirm the purpose of the loan by executing a Business Purpose and Occupancy Affidavit or a similar form. If a Business Purpose disclosure is not in the file, then the merits of the file must indicate that the loan meets the definition of a Business Purpose loan.\n· Special rules also apply to Business Purpose loans where the borrower is taking cash out of the transaction. In such situations, the cash being taken out must also be used for a Business Purpose and not for personal or consumer use. This includes, for example, using the cash-out of the transaction to improve or maintain other rental properties owned by a borrower. An example of an impermissible use would include using the cash-out of transaction to pay for college tuition or personal debt (i.e., for a non-business purpose).\n. All DSCR loans are \"Business Purpose Loans\"; therefore, to be eligible for the product, the owner cannot occupy the property at any time during the coming year and all cash out proceeds must only be used for business purposes (e.g., acquisition/maintenance/improvement of rental properties).\n1.15 OFAC Search\nThe Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) of the US Department of Treasury administers and enforces economic and trade sanctions based on US foreign policy and national security goals against individuals and foreign countries.
