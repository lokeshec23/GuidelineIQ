A reasonable, good-faith ATR evaluation must consider the following eight underwriting factors based on available information in the mortgage loan file using reliable third-party records:\n. Income or assets used to repay the loan.\n· Employment status.\n· Monthly mortgage payment on the subject loan (fully indexed, fully amortizing).\n· Monthly payments for any simultaneous loans secured by the subject property.\n· Monthly payments for property taxes, hazard insurance, HOA fees, or ground rents.\n· Debts (reported by a credit bureau or disclosed by the consumer), alimony, and child support obligations.\n. Monthly DTI or residual income.\n. Credit history.\n1.2 Exceptions & Items Not Addressed in this Guide\nUnless otherwise stated, Fannie Mae definitions, required documentation and underwriting guidelines should be followed. Additionally, while these Underwriting Guidelines are intended to be comprehensive, they may not encompass all specific loan or borrower scenarios.\nIn the event the underwriter determines an exception is warranted, the exception will be considered case by case, with compensating factors such as the below:\n.

Banking Law § 6-M (New York Subprime), FCM does not purchase mortgage loans that meet the definition of \"high cost,\" \"high risk,\" \"covered,\" \"subprime,\" or any similar designation under state or local law.\nNew York Subprime Definition:\nSubprime home loan means a home loan in which the initial interest rate or the fully-indexed rate, whichever is higher, exceeds by more than one and three-quarters percentage points for a first-lien loan, or by more than three and three- quarters percentage points for a subordinate-lien loan, the average commitment rate for loans in the northeast region with a comparable duration to the duration of such home loan, as published by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (herein \"Freddie Mac\") in its weekly Primary Mortgage Market Survey (PMMS) posted in the week prior to the week in which the lender provides the Loan Estimate.\n1.13 State Licensing\nFCM will comply with all applicable state licenses and registration requirements in connection with mortgage loan origination and any other related business activities, which include without limitation:\n· Ensuring that each loan officer/originator/broker involved in the origination of loans are appropriately licensed.\n· Maintaining appropriate organizational licensure based on type and location of the activities it engages in.\n1.14 TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosure (TRID)\nAll loans must comply with TRID rules except for loans originated solely for business purposes, as defined in 12 CFR 1026.3(a)(1)of Regulation Z.\nAs used in this Guide, a \"Business Purpose Loan\" means a loan:\n· Single Family Non-Owner Occupied: To acquire, improve or maintain rental property (regardless of the number of housing units) that is not owner-occupied. This includes, for example, a single-family house that will be rented to another person to live in. If the owner expects to occupy the property for more than 14 days during the coming year, the property cannot be considered non-owner-occupied, and this special rule will not apply. For example, a beach house that the owner will occupy for a month in the coming summer and rent out the rest of the year is owner occupied and is not Business Purpose Loan.\n. Loans meeting this definition of \"Business Purpose\" are not subject to ability to repay and TRID disclosure requirements; borrower(s) must affirm the purpose of the loan by executing a Business Purpose and Occupancy Affidavit or a similar form. If a Business Purpose disclosure is not in the file, then the merits of the file must indicate that the loan meets the definition of a Business Purpose loan.\n· Special rules also apply to Business Purpose loans where the borrower is taking cash out of the transaction. In such situations, the cash being taken out must also be used for a Business Purpose and not for personal or consumer use. This includes, for example, using the cash-out of the transaction to improve or maintain other rental properties owned by a borrower. An example of an impermissible use would include using the cash-out of transaction to pay for college tuition or personal debt (i.e., for a non-business purpose).\n. All DSCR loans are \"Business Purpose Loans\"; therefore, to be eligible for the product, the owner cannot occupy the property at any time during the coming year and all cash out proceeds must only be used for business purposes (e.g., acquisition/maintenance/improvement of rental properties).\n1.15 OFAC Search\nThe Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) of the US Department of Treasury administers and enforces economic and trade sanctions based on US foreign policy and national security goals against individuals and foreign countries.

The property description supplied to an used by the appraiser is assumed to be correct.

However, the appraiser is no qualified to detect such substances. The presence of substances such as asbestos, urea-formaldehyde foam insulation or other potentially hazardous materials may affect the value of the property. The value conclusions in this report are predicated on the assumption that there is no such materials on or in the property that would cause a loss of value. No responsibility is assumed for any such conditions, or for the expertise required to discover them. The client is urged to retain an expert in this field if desired. The analysis and value conclusions in this report are null and void should any hazardous material be discovered.\n8.

In addition to the reporting format offered herein, the scope of work for this appraisal is defined by the complexity of this appraisal assignment including the following definition of market value, statement of assumptions and limiting conditions and certification. The appraiser at a minimum is required to research, verify and analyze meaningful and reliable market data collected from public and private sources to be used in the development of the appraisal, and to report his analysis, opinions, and conclusions in this appraisal report.\nINTENDED USE. The intended use of the Market Rent Analysis is to be a screening tul fur collateral evaluation involving a financial lending institution. This analysis is tut intended to represent a Market Value of the Real Estate or a Market Value of the Going Concern as a short term rental property. INTENDED USER: The intended user is Sample Client, its staff, management, and officers.\nDEFINITION\nMarket Rent - The most probable rent that a property should bring in a competitive and open market under all conditions requisite to a fair lease transaction, the lessee and lessor each acting prudently and knowledgeably, and assuming the rent is not affected by undue stimulus. Implicit in this definition is the execution of a lease as of a specified date under conditions whereby\nLessee and lessor are typically motivated; Both parties are well informed or well advised, and acting in what they consider their best interests;\nPayment is made in terms of cash or in terms of financial arrangements comparable thereto; and\nThe rent reflects specified terms and conditions, such as permitted uses, use restrictions, expense obligations, duration, concessions, rental adjustments and revaluations, renewal and purchase options, and tenant improvements(Tls). (The Dictionary of Real Estate Appraisal. 7th ed., 2022. pp. 116-117) STATEMENT OF ASSUMPTIONS AND LIMITING CONDITIONS: The intended use of the Market Rent Analysis is to be a screening tool for collateral evaluation involving a financial lending institution. This analysis is not intended to represent a Market Value of the Real Estate or a Market Value of theGoing Concern as a short term rental property.\n1. The property description supplied to an used by the appraiser is assumed to be correct. Where property addresses and other incomplete descriptions were supplied and falling short of complete legal descriptions, the appraiser used property tax records, local property data services and other resources available to determine an adequate property description for purposes of performing the market rent analysis. The appraiser assumes no responsibility for damages resulting from inadequate property descriptions by the client.\n2. No survey of the property has been made or reviewed by the appraiser, and no responsibility is assumed in connection with such matters. Illustrative material, including photos, maps, plots, plans, utilized in this report are inclusive only to assist the reader in visualizing the property. Property dimensions and sizes are considered to be approximate.\n3. No responsibility is assumed for matters of a legal nature affecting title to the property, nor is any opinion of title rendered. Property titles are assumed to be good and merchantable unless otherwise stated.\n4. Information furnished by others is believed to be true, correct, and reliable. However, no responsibility for its accuracy is assumed by the appraiser.\n5. All mortgages, liens, leases, property tax obligations and servitudes have been disregarded unless so specified within the report. The property is assumed to be free of all encumbrances and under responsible, financially sound ownership and competent management.\n6. It is assumed that there are no hidden or unapparent conditions of the property, subsoil, or structures which would render the property more or less valuable. No responsibility is assumed for such conditions or for arranging for engineering studies which may be required to discover them.\n7. Unless otherwise stated in this report, the existence of hazardous material, which may or may not be present on the property, was not observed by the appraiser. However, the appraiser is no qualified to detect such substances. The presence of substances such as asbestos, urea-formaldehyde foam insulation or other potentially hazardous materials may affect the value of the property. The value conclusions in this report are predicated on the assumption that there is no such materials on or in the property that would cause a loss of value. No responsibility is assumed for any such conditions, or for the expertise required to discover them. The client is urged to retain an expert in this field if desired. The analysis and value conclusions in this report are null and void should any hazardous material be discovered.\n8.

A reasonable, good-faith ATR evaluation must consider the following eight underwriting factors based on available information in the mortgage loan file using reliable third-party records:\n. Income or assets used to repay the loan.\n· Employment status.\n· Monthly mortgage payment on the subject loan (fully indexed, fully amortizing).\n· Monthly payments for any simultaneous loans secured by the subject property.\n· Monthly payments for property taxes, hazard insurance, HOA fees, or ground rents.\n· Debts (reported by a credit bureau or disclosed by the consumer), alimony, and child support obligations.\n. Monthly DTI or residual income.\n. Credit history.\n1.2 Exceptions & Items Not Addressed in this Guide\nUnless otherwise stated, Fannie Mae definitions, required documentation and underwriting guidelines should be followed. Additionally, while these Underwriting Guidelines are intended to be comprehensive, they may not encompass all specific loan or borrower scenarios.\nIn the event the underwriter determines an exception is warranted, the exception will be considered case by case, with compensating factors such as the below:\n. The borrower's residential payment history for 24 months is 0x30\n· 6 months reserves greater than the program required\n· FICO points greater than 20 points over required\n· DTI >10% below the program requirements or DSCR >1.15\n· LTV 10% below the maximum allowed\n. The borrower has additional income that is not used to qualify\nAll exceptions will be reviewed by the underwriting manager.\n1.3 Fair Lending\nFCM strictly complies with all applicable federal, state, and local requirements related to fair lending, including the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act (together, the \"Fair Lending Requirements\"). Accordingly, in connection with its decision to purchase loans, FCM will not discriminate on any prohibited basis. FCM will also not knowingly purchase loans from Sellers engaged in practices that violate Fair Lending Requirements. To the extent a Seller is found to be engaging in practices that may violate Fair Lending Requirements.\n1.4 Home Mortgage Disclosure ACT (HMDA)\nFCM will comply with the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA), including without limitation all data collection, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements.\n1.5 Higher Priced Mortgage Loan (HPML)\nIf a loan is Higher Priced Mortgage Loan as defined by the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau.\nHigher Priced Mortgage Loans are permitted with certain restrictions:\n· Escrow accounts are required.\n.

Note that the timelines are measured from the date the seller became the legal owner of the property and the date all parties signed the purchase agreement.\n. If the seller acquired the property through the following methods, a second appraisal is not required:\n- Bridge loans (for 12 months or less),\n- Reverse mortgages,\n- Loans for the initial construction of a dwelling - note that this is for a true construction loan, not for the end loan purchase of a newly constructed property,\n- A local, state, or federal government agency,\n- Through a foreclosure or deed in lieu, or\n- Inheritance or through a dissolution of marriage, civil union or domestic partnership, or through the partition of the seller's joint or marital assets.\n1.6 Maximum Interest Credit\nFCM will allow an interest credit through the 5th of the month.\n1.7 Assumability\nLoans are not assumable, regardless of loan program.\n1.8 Net Tangible Benefit\nUnless the mortgage loan is being originated as a Business Purpose loan, originators must ensure the transaction provides a net tangible benefit to the borrower(s). Examples of tangible benefits include but are not limited to:\n· financing the acquisition of a property\n· reducing the cash expenditure required to service an existing mortgage\n· lowering the interest rate of an existing mortgage\n· extending the period during which the interest rate on an existing mortgage is fixed\n· extending the term of an existing mortgage\n· obtaining additional cash proceeds through a cash-out refinance.\nThe tangible benefit provided to the borrowers by the Loan must exceed the borrowers' cost to acquire the Loan.\n1.9 Quality Control\nFCM applies its Quality Control Policy and Procedures to loans originated, ensuring the quality of loans for underwiring, compliance purposes.\n1.10 Qualified Mortgage\nThe Sharp Advantage loan programs are structured as Non-Qualified Mortgage (Non-QM) therefore QM Safe harbor or Rebuttable Presumption requirements do not apply, but rather still must meet the ability to repay standard.\n1.11 Regulatory Compliance\nAll loans originated by FCM will be in compliance with all federal, state, and local laws including without limitation, all statutes, regulations, ordinances, administrative rules, and orders that have the effect of law, and judicial rulings and opinions, that apply to any of their origination, selling, or servicing practices or other business practices and related technology.

Banking Law § 6-M (New York Subprime), FCM does not purchase mortgage loans that meet the definition of \"high cost,\" \"high risk,\" \"covered,\" \"subprime,\" or any similar designation under state or local law.\nNew York Subprime Definition:\nSubprime home loan means a home loan in which the initial interest rate or the fully-indexed rate, whichever is higher, exceeds by more than one and three-quarters percentage points for a first-lien loan, or by more than three and three- quarters percentage points for a subordinate-lien loan, the average commitment rate for loans in the northeast region with a comparable duration to the duration of such home loan, as published by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (herein \"Freddie Mac\") in its weekly Primary Mortgage Market Survey (PMMS) posted in the week prior to the week in which the lender provides the Loan Estimate.\n1.13 State Licensing\nFCM will comply with all applicable state licenses and registration requirements in connection with mortgage loan origination and any other related business activities, which include without limitation:\n· Ensuring that each loan officer/originator/broker involved in the origination of loans are appropriately licensed.\n· Maintaining appropriate organizational licensure based on type and location of the activities it engages in.\n1.14 TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosure (TRID)\nAll loans must comply with TRID rules except for loans originated solely for business purposes, as defined in 12 CFR 1026.3(a)(1)of Regulation Z.\nAs used in this Guide, a \"Business Purpose Loan\" means a loan:\n· Single Family Non-Owner Occupied: To acquire, improve or maintain rental property (regardless of the number of housing units) that is not owner-occupied. This includes, for example, a single-family house that will be rented to another person to live in. If the owner expects to occupy the property for more than 14 days during the coming year, the property cannot be considered non-owner-occupied, and this special rule will not apply. For example, a beach house that the owner will occupy for a month in the coming summer and rent out the rest of the year is owner occupied and is not Business Purpose Loan.\n. Loans meeting this definition of \"Business Purpose\" are not subject to ability to repay and TRID disclosure requirements; borrower(s) must affirm the purpose of the loan by executing a Business Purpose and Occupancy Affidavit or a similar form. If a Business Purpose disclosure is not in the file, then the merits of the file must indicate that the loan meets the definition of a Business Purpose loan.\n· Special rules also apply to Business Purpose loans where the borrower is taking cash out of the transaction. In such situations, the cash being taken out must also be used for a Business Purpose and not for personal or consumer use. This includes, for example, using the cash-out of the transaction to improve or maintain other rental properties owned by a borrower. An example of an impermissible use would include using the cash-out of transaction to pay for college tuition or personal debt (i.e., for a non-business purpose).\n. All DSCR loans are \"Business Purpose Loans\"; therefore, to be eligible for the product, the owner cannot occupy the property at any time during the coming year and all cash out proceeds must only be used for business purposes (e.g., acquisition/maintenance/improvement of rental properties).\n1.15 OFAC Search\nThe Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) of the US Department of Treasury administers and enforces economic and trade sanctions based on US foreign policy and national security goals against individuals and foreign countries. A clear OFAC search for individuals and foreign countries is required.\n· Individuals:\n@ 2024 First Colony Mortgage Corporation. NMLS #3112.

Unless otherwise stated in this report, the existence of hazardous material, which may or may not be present on the property, was not observed by the appraiser. However, the appraiser is no qualified to detect such substances. The presence of substances such as asbestos, urea-formaldehyde foam insulation or other potentially hazardous materials may affect the value of the property. The value conclusions in this report are predicated on the assumption that there is no such materials on or in the property that would cause a loss of value. No responsibility is assumed for any such conditions, or for the expertise required to discover them. The client is urged to retain an expert in this field if desired. The analysis and value conclusions in this report are null and void should any hazardous material be discovered.\n8.

In the event such an inspection was not possible: and or if a limited inspection ws performed or no inspection was performed, this market rent analysis shall so state. In cases where the appraiser was limited in his ability to perform a thorough property inspection, assumptions were made using the best information available to him or her at the time, relative to improvement size, quality, condition, use; and physical attributes of the land and improvements. For purposes of the analysis these assumptions became matters of fact and were used as such.

See EXHIBIT B: Ability-To-Repay Borrower Confirmation for an example in the Exhibits section of this guide. * Note: Business Purpose/Investment property transactions are exempt from completing this form.\nSTATE AND FEDERAL HIGH-COST LOANS\nHigh-cost loans are not permitted.\nPREPAYMENT PENALTY\nFor Investment Property transactions when permitted by applicable laws and regulations, a prepayment charge can be structured to be assessed if prepayment occurs between the first twelve (12) to sixty (60) payments due on the loan.\nThe prepayment charge shall be equal to six (6) months interest at the then applicable Interest Rate on the amount prepaid that exceeds twenty percent (20%) of the original principal balance of the loan. The prepayment charge shall be assessed if the loan is paid due to sale or refinance of the property or any curtailments that exceed twenty percent (20%) of the original principal amount of the loan in any given twelve (12) month period.\nThe following states are subject to local jurisdiction prepayment penalty rules and regulations:\no District of Columbia, Illinois, Michigan, Mississippi, New Jersey, Ohio, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, Utah and Virginia.\n.

The coverage must provide for claims to be settled on a replacement cost basis. Extended coverage must include, at a minimum, wind, civil commotion (including riots), smoke, hail, and damage caused by aircraft, vehicle, or explosion.\nPolicies that limit or exclude from coverage (in whole or in part) windstorm, hurricane, hail damages, or any other perils that normally are included under an extended coverage endorsement are not acceptable.\nBorrowers may not obtain property insurance policies that include such limitations or exclusions unless they are able to obtain a separate policy or endorsement from another commercial insurer that provides adequate coverage for the limited or excluded peril or from an insurance pool that the state has established to cover the limitations or exclusions.\nAdditional requirements apply to properties with solar panels that are leased from or owned by a third party under a power purchase agreement or other similar arrangement.\nThe insurance coverage should reflect one of the following:\n. 100% of the insurable value of the improvements, as established by the property insurer; or\n· 100% of the Total Estimate of Cost-New per the appraiser; or\n. The unpaid principal balance of the mortgage, as long as it at least equals the minimum amount-80% of the insurable value of the improvements-required to compensate for damage or loss on a replacement cost basis. If it does not, then coverage that does provide the minimum required amount must be obtained.\nFor insurance not addressed in this section, default to Fannie Mae requirements.\nRent Loss Insurance\nFor Investment Properties - rent loss insurance covering a minimum of 6 months of the rental figure used to qualify is required for the subject property.\nTRANSACTION TYPES\nELIGIBLE TRANSACTIONS\nPurchase\n.

Unless otherwise stated in this report, the existence of hazardous material, which may or may not be present on the property, was not observed by the appraiser. However, the appraiser is no qualified to detect such substances. The presence of substances such as asbestos, urea-formaldehyde foam insulation or other potentially hazardous materials may affect the value of the property. The value conclusions in this report are predicated on the assumption that there is no such materials on or in the property that would cause a loss of value. No responsibility is assumed for any such conditions, or for the expertise required to discover them. The client is urged to retain an expert in this field if desired. The analysis and value conclusions in this report are null and void should any hazardous material be discovered.\n8.

In the event such an inspection was not possible: and or if a limited inspection ws performed or no inspection was performed, this market rent analysis shall so state. In cases where the appraiser was limited in his ability to perform a thorough property inspection, assumptions were made using the best information available to him or her at the time, relative to improvement size, quality, condition, use; and physical attributes of the land and improvements. For purposes of the analysis these assumptions became matters of fact and were used as such.

A thorough review of the title report in these cases is required as well as the payment history pattern (VOM on the Seller's mortgage).\nInterested Party Transaction\nA Conflict-Of-Interest Transaction occurs when the borrower has an affiliation or relationship with the Mortgage Broker, Loan Officer, Real Estate Broker or Agent, or any other interested party to the transaction. In the case of the Mortgage Broker, Loan Officer, or Real Estate Broker/Agent extra due diligence must be exercised.
